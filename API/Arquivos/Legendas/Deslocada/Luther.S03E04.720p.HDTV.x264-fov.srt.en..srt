1
20:00:00,938 --> 20:00:02,385
Don't move.

2
20:00:03,801 --> 20:00:05,975
- This is my mate, Justin.
- Hey there.

3
20:00:05,991 --> 20:00:07,279
- Hey.
- And I love him.

4
20:00:07,280 --> 20:00:09,642
All I want is what you want.

5
20:00:09,658 --> 20:00:11,011
To have these people locked up,

6
20:00:11,042 --> 20:00:12,911
so they can't do any more harm

7
20:00:13,031 --> 20:00:13,928
to anyone else.

8
20:00:13,928 --> 20:00:16,094
Justin, I think I may
have taken a wrong turn.

9
20:00:16,214 --> 20:00:17,323
Do you want to talk about this properly?

10
20:00:17,362 --> 20:00:19,810
- That's why I'm here.
- No, I mean, properly.

11
20:00:19,820 --> 20:00:22,171
I'm not sure what's
supposed to be going on here.

12
20:00:23,140 --> 20:00:24,666
I'm completely lost.

13
20:00:24,713 --> 20:00:25,886
That's why we're here.

14
20:00:25,894 --> 20:00:29,695
To help you understand
how lost you really are.

15
20:00:30,180 --> 20:00:33,699
How am I supposed to trust
you if you don't trust me?

16
20:00:34,100 --> 20:00:35,580
I will be back.

17
20:00:36,580 --> 20:00:39,019
I'm a copper, we're on the same side.

18
20:00:39,020 --> 20:00:40,276
I don't think you're going to shoot me.

19
20:00:40,613 --> 20:00:42,552
I warned you not to make me your enemy!

20
20:00:42,672 --> 20:00:45,876
- I warned you!
- No. Don't you... don't you...

21
20:00:45,907 --> 20:00:48,180
Hey. Get up!

22
20:01:00,055 --> 20:01:01,940
Justin.

23
20:02:18,604 --> 20:02:20,860
Please.

24
20:02:42,626 --> 20:02:44,778
Oh, God. Key. Key. Key.

25
20:05:09,380 --> 20:05:11,705
Are you ok? You ok?

26
20:05:14,940 --> 20:05:16,580
Mary.

27
20:05:19,220 --> 20:05:21,384
What did John say to you exactly?

28
20:05:22,179 --> 20:05:24,856
He said... he said he was busy.

29
20:05:25,260 --> 20:05:28,020
And that I should meet
him here, at his place.

30
20:05:36,700 --> 20:05:37,551
No.

31
20:05:44,740 --> 20:05:46,086
Erin?

32
20:05:48,500 --> 20:05:50,020
Man down.

33
20:05:51,420 --> 20:05:53,060
Justin Ripley.

34
20:06:19,085 --> 20:06:21,619
So what is it with John Luther

35
20:06:22,345 --> 20:06:24,359
and the people he loves?

36
20:06:47,380 --> 20:06:49,430
John, I don't know what to say.

37
20:06:49,874 --> 20:06:51,395
I don't have the words.

38
20:07:02,900 --> 20:07:05,134
Where is Mary?

39
20:07:07,180 --> 20:07:08,731
John Luther,

40
20:07:09,300 --> 20:07:13,355
you're under arrest for the murder
of Detective Sergeant Justin Ripley

41
20:07:13,980 --> 20:07:16,702
and the attempted murder of Mary Day.

42
20:07:32,224 --> 20:07:34,821
Mary! Hey, Mary. Mary!

43
20:07:35,334 --> 20:07:36,579
Hold on!

44
20:08:48,244 --> 20:08:49,289
Ok.

45
20:08:49,546 --> 20:08:52,411
From this side of the table, it looks like

46
20:08:52,993 --> 20:08:55,477
there's two people who
could incriminate you,

47
20:08:56,420 --> 20:08:58,679
one of which is now dead

48
20:08:58,917 --> 20:09:01,670
by the hand of Tom Marwood.

49
20:09:01,860 --> 20:09:05,361
And Mary Day would be...
had I not intervened.

50
20:09:05,481 --> 20:09:08,208
And you're welcome, by the way.

51
20:09:10,620 --> 20:09:13,500
You told her where to go, John.

52
20:09:15,940 --> 20:09:17,537
You told her where

53
20:09:18,681 --> 20:09:19,720
and when.

54
20:09:20,903 --> 20:09:24,250
And I think you did that
because you wanted Marwood

55
20:09:24,920 --> 20:09:26,628
to kill her for you.

56
20:09:30,860 --> 20:09:32,021
Yesterday,

57
20:09:32,090 --> 20:09:35,456
a few hours before he shot
and killed Justin Ripley,

58
20:09:35,481 --> 20:09:37,615
you spoke for some time to Mr Marwood.

59
20:09:37,900 --> 20:09:40,600
Your report notes that
during this conversation,

60
20:09:40,618 --> 20:09:43,420
Tom Marwood asked for more time.

61
20:09:45,274 --> 20:09:47,540
"Give me two days."

62
20:09:50,573 --> 20:09:52,081
And then you let him go.

63
20:09:54,180 --> 20:09:57,093
Which makes me wonder,
what was the quid pro quo?

64
20:09:57,140 --> 20:09:58,269
Shut your mouth.

65
20:09:58,306 --> 20:10:00,108
You let Marwood

66
20:10:00,822 --> 20:10:04,995
run free to kill his paedophiles and his

67
20:10:05,195 --> 20:10:07,104
scumbags.

68
20:10:09,220 --> 20:10:11,076
That's no skin off your nose.

69
20:10:11,107 --> 20:10:12,715
No humans involved.

70
20:10:12,778 --> 20:10:14,504
But then in exchange,

71
20:10:14,554 --> 20:10:16,000
does you a favour.

72
20:10:18,460 --> 20:10:20,700
He cleans up your mess.

73
20:10:30,215 --> 20:10:31,415
I loved him.

74
20:10:56,980 --> 20:10:58,879
He's got too many friends.

75
20:10:59,085 --> 20:11:00,706
We'll have to move him.

76
20:11:33,333 --> 20:11:34,659
What is this, John?

77
20:11:35,066 --> 20:11:36,618
I don't know, George.

78
20:11:37,037 --> 20:11:38,532
Stay here.

79
20:12:09,100 --> 20:12:10,519
Erin!

80
20:12:26,818 --> 20:12:28,540
Wotcher.

81
20:12:31,300 --> 20:12:35,457
'Detective Ripley has been hailed
a hero by his colleagues after

82
20:12:35,500 --> 20:12:39,029
'he was shot point blank in the
chest by vigilante Thomas Marwood

83
20:12:39,035 --> 20:12:41,113
'who has been branded a coward... '

84
20:13:01,180 --> 20:13:02,424
Oh.

85
20:13:03,275 --> 20:13:05,503
If you're going to go on the
run you're going to have to, er,

86
20:13:05,503 --> 20:13:07,092
lose the coat.

87
20:13:07,820 --> 20:13:09,407
It's my lucky coat.

88
20:13:10,020 --> 20:13:11,383
Lucky?!

89
20:13:11,878 --> 20:13:14,224
Right. Well, I would take it
back to the shop, if I was you.

90
20:13:14,620 --> 20:13:16,946
Get your money back.
It's obviously defective.

91
20:13:26,300 --> 20:13:27,662
This is a nice place.

92
20:13:28,300 --> 20:13:29,939
Is it yours?

93
20:13:29,940 --> 20:13:31,700
Don't be silly.

94
20:13:32,611 --> 20:13:34,075
Alice, what are you doing here?

95
20:13:34,500 --> 20:13:35,780
I saw the news.

96
20:13:36,647 --> 20:13:37,873
Where have you been?

97
20:13:38,300 --> 20:13:39,462
Berlin.

98
20:13:39,860 --> 20:13:40,994
I don't believe you.

99
20:13:41,580 --> 20:13:43,300
Oh, you should.

100
20:13:52,180 --> 20:13:54,316
I assumed you'd need it, eventually.

101
20:13:54,940 --> 20:13:56,620
Not yet.

102
20:13:58,195 --> 20:13:59,759
After Marwood.

103
20:14:00,404 --> 20:14:01,880
Then I'm done.

104
20:14:01,918 --> 20:14:04,220
Why? Because he killed your puppy?

105
20:14:06,100 --> 20:14:07,786
Oh, that's why you're here?

106
20:14:08,962 --> 20:14:10,589
To rub my nose in it?

107
20:14:10,860 --> 20:14:11,908
No.

108
20:14:13,466 --> 20:14:15,606
I came to help the people you love.

109
20:14:15,919 --> 20:14:16,744
I'm sorry?

110
20:14:16,794 --> 20:14:19,272
You assert this fabulous
moral conscience, John.

111
20:14:20,022 --> 20:14:23,019
This adherence to unwritten
law. Yet, time and again,

112
20:14:23,301 --> 20:14:27,300
it devastates the people you claim
to hold dear, but you don't stop.

113
20:14:28,326 --> 20:14:32,342
It seems to me your conscience
has killed more people than I have.

114
20:14:55,420 --> 20:14:58,251
Well, you know, you say "escape," George,

115
20:14:58,288 --> 20:15:01,980
but to me, this looks more like
the scene of a violent abduction.

116
20:15:04,220 --> 20:15:05,665
By Marwood?

117
20:15:06,380 --> 20:15:07,341
Presumably.

118
20:15:07,366 --> 20:15:08,812
Why not pop him here?

119
20:15:09,756 --> 20:15:11,133
The way he did Ripley?

120
20:15:11,176 --> 20:15:13,942
Well, we won't know that
until we ask him, will we?

121
20:15:13,967 --> 20:15:15,244
In the meantime,

122
20:15:15,287 --> 20:15:16,708
somewhere out there,

123
20:15:16,733 --> 20:15:18,297
there is a police officer

124
20:15:18,417 --> 20:15:20,637
in the hands of a known police killer.

125
20:15:20,656 --> 20:15:22,464
Well, either way, Martin...

126
20:15:23,009 --> 20:15:25,180
we both want DCI Luther

127
20:15:25,211 --> 20:15:26,444
returned to us

128
20:15:26,675 --> 20:15:28,357
at the earliest opportunity.

129
20:15:28,352 --> 20:15:30,404
A search is under way.

130
20:15:30,417 --> 20:15:31,881
Then widen it.

131
20:15:34,064 --> 20:15:35,090
You know, George,

132
20:15:35,128 --> 20:15:38,412
the Tom Marwood investigation
is under my command,

133
20:15:38,600 --> 20:15:40,052
and God help you

134
20:15:40,060 --> 20:15:41,309
if you interfere with it

135
20:15:41,429 --> 20:15:43,668
or question my allocation of resources.

136
20:15:44,362 --> 20:15:47,040
DCI Luther does have some loyal friends,

137
20:15:47,221 --> 20:15:49,540
- doesn't he?
- Oh, yes, he does.

138
20:15:54,620 --> 20:15:58,229
'One officer was shot dead
and another badly injured.

139
20:15:58,500 --> 20:16:01,728
'In what the police say
may be a related incident,

140
20:16:01,778 --> 20:16:05,019
'Milan Knizac has been
attacked in Mortlake Prison.

141
20:16:05,340 --> 20:16:07,299
'Knizac is serving a life sentence

20:16:07,300 --> 20:16:11,169
'for the murder of Caitlin

20:16:17,540 --> 20:16:20,100
'less than halfway through

146
20:16:22,486 --> 20:16:24,629
- What do you want?
- Don't move!

147
20:16:40,959 --> 20:16:42,854
So where are we going?

148
20:16:42,873 --> 20:16:44,738
We're taking you somewhere safe,

149
20:16:44,925 --> 20:16:46,158
just to be sure.

150
20:16:46,683 --> 20:16:49,620
But you can't honestly think
John would ever hurt me?

151
20:17:42,300 --> 20:17:43,989
So where did you go?

152
20:17:44,646 --> 20:17:47,337
Oh, here and there. Got married.

153
20:17:48,012 --> 20:17:49,419
- You got what?
- Married.

154
20:17:49,626 --> 20:17:50,571
Why?

155
20:17:51,300 --> 20:17:53,762
Does it add a tingle of the
illicit to the conversation?

156
20:17:53,882 --> 20:17:58,016
It adds a tingle of
disbelief, is what it does.

157
20:17:58,700 --> 20:18:01,006
- Erm, where did you and...
- Bertrand.

158
20:18:02,019 --> 20:18:03,939
A conference in Sao Paolo.

159
20:18:04,265 --> 20:18:06,755
Oh, he was intensely intellectual.

160
20:18:07,425 --> 20:18:09,932
- He "was"?
- Sadly, he passed away.

161
20:18:10,052 --> 20:18:12,854
Some little girls grow up wanting ponies.

162
20:18:14,231 --> 20:18:15,864
I always wanted to be a widow.

163
20:18:18,579 --> 20:18:20,769
So, what about you?

164
20:18:21,740 --> 20:18:25,336
Have you found someone, hmm?

165
20:18:30,100 --> 20:18:31,292
Yeah. Kind of.

166
20:18:32,244 --> 20:18:33,677
And is she interesting?

167
20:18:33,797 --> 20:18:35,291
- To whom?
- Me!

168
20:18:35,660 --> 20:18:37,356
- I don't know.
- Well,

169
20:18:37,476 --> 20:18:39,351
I imagine she wouldn't be, terribly.

170
20:18:39,389 --> 20:18:41,760
She wouldn't be some kind of Zoe surrogate.

171
20:18:42,023 --> 20:18:45,060
You've got enough self-knowledge
to avoid that trap.

172
20:18:49,062 --> 20:18:50,900
So she's a pixie.

173
20:18:51,465 --> 20:18:53,204
- A what?
- A pixie.

174
20:18:54,049 --> 20:18:55,139
A sprite.

175
20:18:55,140 --> 20:18:58,291
A daydream of the life you
imagine you want to live.

176
20:18:59,230 --> 20:19:01,414
Oh, dear, I feel a bit sorry for her.

177
20:19:01,457 --> 20:19:02,746
You don't feel sorry for anyone.

178
20:19:02,803 --> 20:19:03,973
Well, quite.

179
20:19:04,342 --> 20:19:05,937
But in principle, I pity her.

180
20:19:05,962 --> 20:19:08,152
She's not what you want.

181
20:19:08,897 --> 20:19:10,260
She's what you want to want.

182
20:19:10,267 --> 20:19:12,220
What is it I want exactly?

183
20:19:15,535 --> 20:19:17,324
We're not talking about that.

184
20:19:17,731 --> 20:19:19,095
We're talking about Pixie.

185
20:19:19,139 --> 20:19:21,179
- Pix... her name is Mary.
- I know.

186
20:19:30,860 --> 20:19:33,940
'The officer shot dead
last night has been named

187
20:19:34,060 --> 20:19:36,501
'as Detective Sergeant Justin Ripley.

188
20:19:36,500 --> 20:19:39,367
'Detective Sergeant Ripley is
believed to have been killed

189
20:19:39,380 --> 20:19:43,810
'by Tom Marwood who first appealed to
the public in this video yesterday.'

190
20:19:44,592 --> 20:19:45,887
'Four years ago,

191
20:19:46,007 --> 20:19:48,927
'she was raped and murdered
by a man called Milan Knizac.'

192
20:19:49,328 --> 20:19:50,817
This him?

193
20:19:51,380 --> 20:19:52,624
This is him.

194
20:19:53,260 --> 20:19:57,723
Goodness gracious me.
What a needy little fishy.

195
20:19:57,754 --> 20:19:59,712
Oh, he's got a hero complex.

196
20:20:00,457 --> 20:20:03,691
He needs public opinion to
justify his own actions to himself.

197
20:20:07,140 --> 20:20:09,691
So what's the plan, Stan?

198
20:20:10,980 --> 20:20:13,139
I take away everything he wants.

199
20:20:13,140 --> 20:20:14,115
What does he want?

200
20:20:14,121 --> 20:20:15,560
To avenge his wife.

201
20:20:15,680 --> 20:20:17,862
To be admired. To become a martyr.

202
20:20:17,900 --> 20:20:20,227
All to make his wife's
death mean something.

203
20:20:20,684 --> 20:20:22,500
You'd take all that from him?

204
20:20:25,980 --> 20:20:26,853
Yeah.

205
20:20:27,460 --> 20:20:29,060
That's cruel.

206
20:20:30,540 --> 20:20:32,314
It's the cruellest thing I can think of.

207
20:20:34,940 --> 20:20:35,924
Ok.

208
20:20:36,818 --> 20:20:38,627
But if any police

209
20:20:38,747 --> 20:20:40,040
aren't out there looking for him,

210
20:20:40,078 --> 20:20:41,961
they're out there looking for you. So...

211
20:20:43,482 --> 20:20:45,409
how do we even begin?

212
20:20:45,529 --> 20:20:46,479
Well.

213
20:20:47,160 --> 20:20:48,737
First step.

214
20:20:48,931 --> 20:20:50,539
You're Thomas Marwood.

215
20:20:50,552 --> 20:20:52,253
You want to kill the man
that killed your wife.

216
20:20:52,373 --> 20:20:54,737
But Milan Knizac is in prison.

217
20:20:54,793 --> 20:20:57,646
So how would you do it?

218
20:20:59,060 --> 20:21:00,374
With leverage.

219
20:21:01,507 --> 20:21:03,077
Give me a lever long enough

220
20:21:03,390 --> 20:21:05,305
and a fulcrum on which to place it,

221
20:21:05,425 --> 20:21:06,462
and...

222
20:21:08,127 --> 20:21:10,072
I can move the world.

223
20:21:38,740 --> 20:21:39,868
Nat?

224
20:21:46,038 --> 20:21:47,326
Nat?!

225
20:21:57,260 --> 20:21:57,815
Hello?

226
20:21:57,853 --> 20:21:59,160
It's not an easy thing, is it,

227
20:21:59,185 --> 20:22:01,156
when your wife is taken from you?

228
20:22:01,638 --> 20:22:03,445
Well, do as I tell you

229
20:22:03,996 --> 20:22:05,366
and you'll get her back.

230
20:22:34,060 --> 20:22:36,020
What is this place?

231
20:22:38,406 --> 20:22:40,177
Nobody knows we're here, Mary.

232
20:22:40,471 --> 20:22:41,835
Not John,

233
20:22:41,955 --> 20:22:42,936
none of his friends.

234
20:22:42,949 --> 20:22:44,957
So, as long as we stay here,

235
20:22:45,201 --> 20:22:46,546
we're safe, ok?

236
20:22:46,765 --> 20:22:50,020
Just... try and make yourself comfortable.

237
20:23:24,580 --> 20:23:25,846
Benny.

238
20:23:31,820 --> 20:23:33,060
Schenk.

239
20:23:43,780 --> 20:23:45,335
Well, never let it be said

240
20:23:45,373 --> 20:23:48,540
that you are less than
audacious, Miss Morgan.

241
20:23:48,576 --> 20:23:52,048
Well, I've got an issue
with impulse control, Martin.

242
20:23:52,168 --> 20:23:54,545
It's in the genes apparently.

243
20:23:54,607 --> 20:23:58,223
You know, Miss Morgan, I must
remind you, I'm a police officer

244
20:23:58,448 --> 20:24:01,570
and you are a fugitive from justice.

245
20:24:01,620 --> 20:24:03,054
And that, by walking in here,

246
20:24:03,073 --> 20:24:06,595
you have, by default,
surrendered your liberty.

247
20:24:07,083 --> 20:24:09,692
Well, you're entitled to send me back.

248
20:24:10,124 --> 20:24:11,462
I wouldn't take it personally.

249
20:24:11,462 --> 20:24:13,671
- Besides, I'd only escape.
- I have no doubt.

250
20:24:13,677 --> 20:24:15,328
Meanwhile, John will be in prison.

251
20:24:15,541 --> 20:24:16,379
Or dead

252
20:24:17,174 --> 20:24:18,807
at the hands of Tom Marwood.

253
20:24:21,234 --> 20:24:23,617
Now, me, I'm as guilty as sin.

254
20:24:24,043 --> 20:24:25,732
Name it, I've done it.

255
20:24:25,769 --> 20:24:26,551
But...

256
20:24:26,952 --> 20:24:30,474
John's as innocent as I am culpable.

257
20:24:30,912 --> 20:24:34,171
So I suppose the question I'm
here to ask is which matters more?

258
20:24:34,653 --> 20:24:36,205
Punishing my guilt?

259
20:24:36,981 --> 20:24:38,977
Or proving John's innocence?

260
20:24:39,700 --> 20:24:40,728
Now John

261
20:24:41,404 --> 20:24:43,843
has asked me to tell you that Tom Marwood

262
20:24:43,963 --> 20:24:46,609
won't allow himself to be arrested.

263
20:24:47,500 --> 20:24:49,924
He intends to commit suicide by cop,

264
20:24:49,955 --> 20:24:51,926
to die a martyr to his own cause.

265
20:24:52,046 --> 20:24:54,792
Now John knows how to bring him in alive.

266
20:24:54,836 --> 20:24:55,887
But...

267
20:24:56,644 --> 20:24:58,302
he's going to need

268
20:24:59,053 --> 20:25:00,210
your support.

269
20:25:01,780 --> 20:25:03,780
What exactly does he need?

270
20:25:07,380 --> 20:25:08,781
For starters,

271
20:25:09,419 --> 20:25:12,566
anything you have on Milan Knizac.

272
20:25:12,580 --> 20:25:13,505
Oh,

273
20:25:13,943 --> 20:25:17,490
and I'm going to need a personnel file.

274
20:25:20,919 --> 20:25:22,300
Thank you, boys.

275
20:25:32,540 --> 20:25:34,038
Why did you come back?

276
20:25:34,700 --> 20:25:36,172
I beg your pardon?

277
20:25:36,292 --> 20:25:37,736
You heard.

278
20:25:37,911 --> 20:25:39,713
I told you. I saw the news.

279
20:25:40,007 --> 20:25:42,215
Alice, come on.

280
20:25:42,571 --> 20:25:44,317
None of this Berlin bullshit.

281
20:25:44,924 --> 20:25:46,463
You've been in London for weeks.

282
20:25:46,520 --> 20:25:47,796
What makes you say that?

283
20:25:47,821 --> 20:25:50,361
I saw a receipt for those boots.

284
20:25:55,340 --> 20:25:57,087
I wanted something.

285
20:25:57,207 --> 20:25:58,870
- What?
- You.

286
20:26:04,756 --> 20:26:07,872
- Alice, Mary and I...
- Oh, do be serious.

287
20:26:08,923 --> 20:26:11,313
You'll be bored silly
by the end of the week.

288
20:26:11,826 --> 20:26:13,803
- You and I are...
- What?

289
20:26:16,725 --> 20:26:18,058
Well...

290
20:26:30,660 --> 20:26:32,152
- What do I do?
- Let me have it, please.

291
20:26:32,190 --> 20:26:34,336
Erin, no. Leave it, it's fine.

292
20:26:34,386 --> 20:26:37,202
If it's him, it's important we know

293
20:26:37,221 --> 20:26:39,098
what he says. Ok.

294
20:26:39,955 --> 20:26:40,975
Answer.

295
20:26:42,420 --> 20:26:43,546
Hello?

296
20:26:43,584 --> 20:26:44,704
'Mary.

297
20:26:45,042 --> 20:26:46,418
Where are you?'

298
20:26:48,220 --> 20:26:50,222
I can't tell you that, John.

299
20:26:50,342 --> 20:26:51,418
They...

300
20:26:51,843 --> 20:26:53,263
they won't let me tell you.

301
20:26:53,383 --> 20:26:55,816
All right. Ok, of course they won't.

302
20:26:56,079 --> 20:26:57,393
Look, I won't be long, ok?

303
20:26:57,393 --> 20:26:58,625
I just want to tell you something

304
20:26:58,650 --> 20:27:00,703
and I want you to hear
me say it, all right?

305
20:27:00,823 --> 20:27:04,219
I haven't done any of the
things they're saying I did.

306
20:27:07,967 --> 20:27:09,031
Are you ok?

307
20:27:09,243 --> 20:27:10,563
Yeah.

308
20:27:10,858 --> 20:27:13,335
Hi, yeah, we've got a trace on DCI Luther.

309
20:27:13,380 --> 20:27:14,593
Well, look, don't be scared.

310
20:27:14,612 --> 20:27:16,945
George Stark's a bit of a dick

311
20:27:17,001 --> 20:27:18,922
but he means well, I guess.

312
20:27:19,420 --> 20:27:21,775
And Erin Grey, well, she just...

313
20:27:22,194 --> 20:27:24,077
she's got me all wrong, all right.

314
20:27:24,334 --> 20:27:26,386
But she's a good woman and...

315
20:27:27,056 --> 20:27:28,826
when push comes to shove, you can,

316
20:27:29,402 --> 20:27:31,285
- well, you can trust her.
- Ok.

317
20:27:31,960 --> 20:27:33,724
Are they with you now?

318
20:27:37,460 --> 20:27:39,567
What about you? Are you, um...

319
20:27:40,731 --> 20:27:41,826
Ok?

320
20:27:42,464 --> 20:27:43,866
Yeah.

321
20:27:47,980 --> 20:27:49,580
Yeah.

322
20:28:05,202 --> 20:28:06,860
Benny...

323
20:28:13,363 --> 20:28:15,177
Guv, can I have a word?

324
20:28:15,534 --> 20:28:17,660
- Huh?
- Now, please.

325
20:28:28,253 --> 20:28:29,905
What the hell was that?

326
20:28:30,287 --> 20:28:31,588
Letting her talk to him?

327
20:28:31,632 --> 20:28:33,140
What if he traces the call?

328
20:28:34,980 --> 20:28:36,556
Oh, my God.

329
20:28:38,780 --> 20:28:41,580
You're trying to lure
him here! Are you mad?

330
20:29:13,260 --> 20:29:15,618
- How is she?
- Safe.

331
20:29:20,905 --> 20:29:22,488
Did you find anyone?

332
20:29:23,764 --> 20:29:26,261
It'll be in one of these.

333
20:29:31,260 --> 20:29:32,755
Ok. Ok.

334
20:29:33,224 --> 20:29:36,578
Oh, I'm bored of this already. Ok.

335
20:29:36,822 --> 20:29:38,812
Milan Knizac is in the prison hospital

336
20:29:38,824 --> 20:29:39,925
because someone cut his throat.

337
20:29:39,944 --> 20:29:42,503
Joe Green has got access to him.

338
20:29:42,534 --> 20:29:43,820
He's a prison doctor.

339
20:29:43,940 --> 20:29:46,025
He's also married to Natalie
Green, who's pregnant.

340
20:29:46,088 --> 20:29:48,096
So that's who I'd go for,

341
20:29:48,115 --> 20:29:49,635
if I wanted Milan Knizac dead.

342
20:29:49,629 --> 20:29:52,645
And I needed leverage.

343
20:30:13,785 --> 20:30:15,739
- Who are you?
- Police.

344
20:30:15,740 --> 20:30:18,639
He said no police! No police!

345
20:30:18,639 --> 20:30:20,692
Just stay there, just stay there.

346
20:30:22,694 --> 20:30:24,727
Alice, Marwood's gone.

347
20:30:25,015 --> 20:30:27,672
We missed him, all right. He's long gone.

348
20:30:42,140 --> 20:30:44,740
All right, so what did he say exactly?

349
20:30:45,340 --> 20:30:47,393
That I should report to work tomorrow

350
20:30:47,420 --> 20:30:49,539
and kill Milan Knizac
with a lethal injection.

351
20:30:49,540 --> 20:30:50,780
And if you don't?

352
20:30:52,020 --> 20:30:55,980
He'll make sure that what Knizac
did to his wife is done to mine.

353
20:30:58,010 --> 20:31:00,581
- He said that if I called the police...
- I'm not police.

354
20:31:01,313 --> 20:31:02,940
I was the police. But I'm not any more.

355
20:31:02,921 --> 20:31:04,148
Who the hell are you then?

356
20:31:04,198 --> 20:31:06,900
I'm the man that's going
to bring Natalie back.

357
20:31:08,460 --> 20:31:10,429
Where are you going? You
can't just leave me here!

358
20:31:10,454 --> 20:31:12,969
If I take you with me,
you'll do something stupid.

359
20:31:13,089 --> 20:31:15,490
You won't be able to help
yourself. You love Natalie, right?

360
20:31:17,236 --> 20:31:19,106
What about him? Tom
Marwood? What about him?

361
20:31:19,094 --> 20:31:21,060
He won't know what hit him.

362
20:31:24,260 --> 20:31:26,614
Benny, small change of plans.

363
20:31:26,734 --> 20:31:29,091
I need you to get a
trace on the last number

364
20:31:29,479 --> 20:31:30,849
who called this phone.

365
20:31:31,337 --> 20:31:32,489
Yeah.

366
20:32:16,180 --> 20:32:17,140
Hello.

367
20:32:17,434 --> 20:32:18,798
This is

368
20:32:19,311 --> 20:32:20,775
Ryan Clark.

369
20:32:22,180 --> 20:32:23,690
He was over the limit,

370
20:32:23,916 --> 20:32:25,536
high on meth,

371
20:32:26,231 --> 20:32:28,990
he was banned from driving and behind

372
20:32:29,318 --> 20:32:30,982
the wheel of a stolen car

373
20:32:31,026 --> 20:32:33,229
when he ran over and killed

374
20:32:34,236 --> 20:32:35,919
a 12-year-old boy.

375
20:32:38,178 --> 20:32:41,037
Mr Clark then fled the scene.

376
20:32:41,575 --> 20:32:44,979
He was in prison for less than five years.

377
20:32:44,980 --> 20:32:47,907
This is not about Ryan Clark's rights...

378
20:32:48,027 --> 20:32:50,419
this is about our responsibilities.

379
20:32:50,420 --> 20:32:52,776
This is about us doing for ourselves

380
20:32:52,832 --> 20:32:55,316
what the state refuses to do for us.

381
20:32:57,380 --> 20:32:59,702
People like me have tried to be reasonable,

382
20:32:59,727 --> 20:33:02,998
we have tried to be reasonable
but nobody's listened.

383
20:33:03,118 --> 20:33:04,575
Oh, boy.

384
20:33:05,520 --> 20:33:07,978
He really does need the
world to love him, doesn't he?

385
20:33:08,016 --> 20:33:10,694
So now a 12-year-old boy is dead.

386
20:33:11,140 --> 20:33:13,222
My wife is dead.

387
20:33:14,135 --> 20:33:17,157
Many other people are dead.

388
20:33:20,180 --> 20:33:21,780
Well, no more.

389
20:33:23,501 --> 20:33:27,243
I have a list of people like Ryan Clark

390
20:33:27,906 --> 20:33:29,545
and I will execute them

391
20:33:29,665 --> 20:33:31,729
at a rate of one a day,

392
20:33:32,142 --> 20:33:34,776
every day, until the Prime Minister agrees

393
20:33:34,776 --> 20:33:36,521
to hold a referendum

394
20:33:37,341 --> 20:33:40,300
on the death penalty. Now,
that's all I'm asking for,

395
20:33:40,420 --> 20:33:43,021
is for the people of this country

396
20:33:43,065 --> 20:33:44,460
to be given a choice.

397
20:33:44,460 --> 20:33:47,763
It's not like you gave
Justin Ripley a choice, is it?

398
20:33:49,980 --> 20:33:51,773
That man's death is on your head.

399
20:33:51,798 --> 20:33:53,144
Well, I don't see how that can be right.

400
20:33:53,162 --> 20:33:54,658
I didn't ask you to kill him.

401
20:33:54,677 --> 20:33:56,260
I warned you to stay away.

402
20:33:56,380 --> 20:33:59,676
You can't hold me accountable
if you choose not to listen.

403
20:33:59,676 --> 20:34:01,784
See, the thing is, I
can hold you accountable.

404
20:34:02,060 --> 20:34:03,861
Me being a copper and all that.

405
20:34:15,661 --> 20:34:18,033
- What... g... give me that camera.
- Oh, I don't think so.

406
20:34:18,045 --> 20:34:20,448
Give me that camera or I will shoot him!

407
20:34:20,460 --> 20:34:21,737
No, you won't, Thomas.

408
20:34:22,300 --> 20:34:23,669
Not on camera,

409
20:34:24,057 --> 20:34:27,220
because people do hate a cop killer

410
20:34:27,340 --> 20:34:29,256
and you so very much want to be admired,

411
20:34:30,194 --> 20:34:32,579
which is a defect, really,
in a multiple murderer but...

412
20:34:32,580 --> 20:34:35,093
- Do not move another step.
- She's got a point there, Tom.

413
20:34:35,100 --> 20:34:37,652
I mean, you're not going to
shoot an innocent man, a cop.

414
20:34:37,700 --> 20:34:39,219
Not for the world to see.

415
20:34:39,220 --> 20:34:41,257
Turn off the camera!
Turn off that camera now!

416
20:34:41,263 --> 20:34:44,780
Why don't you just stop
all this, all right?

417
20:34:44,804 --> 20:34:47,425
And tell us where you're
keeping Natalie Green.

418
20:34:47,494 --> 20:34:50,260
Who has she ever hurt in her life? No-one.

419
20:34:50,380 --> 20:34:51,668
Not to mention the fact

420
20:34:51,693 --> 20:34:53,239
- that she's pregnant.
- Shut up!

421
20:34:53,714 --> 20:34:55,816
- Shut up!
- Come on, Tom. Come on!

422
20:34:55,936 --> 20:34:57,487
Just let her go.

423
20:34:58,688 --> 20:35:01,820
You being the... the
defender of the innocent.

424
20:35:03,460 --> 20:35:05,076
Stop, stop! Turn it off!

425
20:35:05,101 --> 20:35:08,048
Whoever the hell you
are, turn off that camera.

426
20:35:08,580 --> 20:35:10,607
Tell her to turn it off.

427
20:35:10,620 --> 20:35:13,292
Look. Look, just put it down. Put it down.

428
20:35:13,285 --> 20:35:15,300
Put it down and turn it
off. Do as the man says.

429
20:35:15,344 --> 20:35:17,321
You hear me, do it, do it, do it.

430
20:35:22,940 --> 20:35:24,700
Now move away, move away.

431
20:35:31,218 --> 20:35:33,608
Oh, what are you going
to do now, DCI Luther?

432
20:35:33,646 --> 20:35:35,091
What are you going to do now, Tom?

433
20:35:35,211 --> 20:35:36,593
She's not going to come back, you know.

434
20:35:36,606 --> 20:35:38,864
- I don't care if she does. I've got the camera.
- Problem is,

435
20:35:39,100 --> 20:35:41,055
the world is going to see that

436
20:35:41,336 --> 20:35:42,894
you're not actually a hero.

437
20:35:42,938 --> 20:35:45,535
You're just a cop killer

438
20:35:45,655 --> 20:35:48,744
that would kidnap a pregnant woman.

439
20:35:48,756 --> 20:35:50,646
I mean, come on, that's nasty!

440
20:35:50,646 --> 20:35:53,192
She's gone, Tom. There's
no point running after her.

441
20:35:53,261 --> 20:35:54,881
She's gone.

442
20:36:05,404 --> 20:36:06,380
Bingo.

443
20:36:06,681 --> 20:36:08,345
You, you! Bring her back!

444
20:36:08,539 --> 20:36:10,334
- Bring her back!
- Tom,

445
20:36:10,378 --> 20:36:12,242
it's not like I can actually

446
20:36:12,542 --> 20:36:14,819
show the tape to anyone really.

447
20:36:14,939 --> 20:36:16,921
W... why not? Why not?

448
20:36:17,041 --> 20:36:19,111
Let's say I did. What do you stand to lose?

449
20:36:19,136 --> 20:36:21,683
You... you still can kill Natalie Green.

450
20:36:21,715 --> 20:36:23,542
I don't have her, you do.

451
20:36:23,998 --> 20:36:26,464
So, er, I've got what you want.

452
20:36:26,514 --> 20:36:28,591
And you've got what I want.

453
20:36:32,740 --> 20:36:34,002
So what do we do now?

454
20:36:34,300 --> 20:36:36,098
You take me to Natalie.

455
20:36:36,218 --> 20:36:37,781
All right, you let her go.

456
20:36:39,451 --> 20:36:41,822
What and then you, you
give me back the tape?

457
20:36:43,220 --> 20:36:44,980
Give it right back.

458
20:36:49,700 --> 20:36:50,844
Liar.

459
20:36:59,860 --> 20:37:01,385
See, you forgot

460
20:37:02,067 --> 20:37:05,101
that I had stolen...

461
20:37:07,460 --> 20:37:09,356
I stole your phone, remember?

462
20:37:10,019 --> 20:37:13,811
So I have heard all those
lovely, intimate messages from...

463
20:37:14,956 --> 20:37:16,357
Mary Day, was it?

464
20:37:24,157 --> 20:37:25,314
So,

465
20:37:26,340 --> 20:37:27,567
you get me that tape,

466
20:37:27,610 --> 20:37:29,569
and I give you back

467
20:37:29,689 --> 20:37:30,876
your Mary.

468
20:37:32,178 --> 20:37:33,480
Ok?

469
20:38:37,155 --> 20:38:38,357
I'm a police officer.

470
20:38:38,350 --> 20:38:39,696
Give us that phone, I need that phone.

471
20:38:39,746 --> 20:38:42,386
- What are you doing?
- I just need this phone.

472
20:38:45,700 --> 20:38:46,227
Hello?

473
20:38:46,227 --> 20:38:47,723
Put George on the phone now.

474
20:38:47,923 --> 20:38:49,468
On speaker. Just do it!

475
20:38:49,660 --> 20:38:51,652
Ok. Ok. You're on speaker.

476
20:38:51,700 --> 20:38:55,300
You have to get Mary
out of there right now!

477
20:38:56,425 --> 20:38:57,633
Do you understand me?

478
20:38:57,651 --> 20:38:58,834
I think we've had enough of that.

479
20:39:00,980 --> 20:39:02,213
What are you doing?

480
20:39:03,620 --> 20:39:04,584
George?

481
20:39:04,704 --> 20:39:06,817
He's trying to lure us out of here.

482
20:39:07,887 --> 20:39:09,420
Please, trust me.

483
20:39:09,464 --> 20:39:12,298
Boss, you need to get
C019 down to Paragon...

484
20:39:12,317 --> 20:39:13,962
Paragon Towers right now.

485
20:39:14,500 --> 20:39:16,060
Get them there.

486
20:39:39,100 --> 20:39:40,860
Hello, Tinkerbell.

487
20:40:08,260 --> 20:40:09,656
It's John.

488
20:40:10,513 --> 20:40:12,696
There's nothing to worry about.

489
20:40:14,624 --> 20:40:17,057
We need you to stay here, ok?

490
20:40:45,060 --> 20:40:46,944
- Who the hell are you?
- Shh.

491
20:40:54,312 --> 20:40:55,607
What's that?

492
20:40:55,995 --> 20:40:57,490
Proof you shouldn't need

493
20:40:57,490 --> 20:40:59,967
of the kind of man John Luther actually is.

494
20:41:22,853 --> 20:41:24,736
When Stark and the lesbian get back,

495
20:41:24,736 --> 20:41:25,712
you show them this.

496
20:41:25,700 --> 20:41:27,676
Oh, and if you ever

497
20:41:27,739 --> 20:41:29,365
betray him like this again...

498
20:41:31,505 --> 20:41:33,860
I'll kill you and eat you.

499
20:41:39,101 --> 20:41:40,853
How does that sound?

500
20:42:27,100 --> 20:42:27,942
What's your name?

501
20:42:27,961 --> 20:42:29,362
What?

502
20:42:29,482 --> 20:42:31,295
What's your name?

503
20:42:33,660 --> 20:42:35,380
Are you Mary?

504
20:42:36,434 --> 20:42:37,655
Are you Mary?!

505
20:42:37,667 --> 20:42:40,245
Yes. Yes, yes, I'm Mary.

506
20:42:40,539 --> 20:42:42,585
Did John send you to do this?

507
20:42:43,220 --> 20:42:44,687
To do what?

508
20:42:45,331 --> 20:42:47,828
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- John Luther.

509
20:42:50,740 --> 20:42:52,551
I know what Mary sounds like.

510
20:42:53,177 --> 20:42:56,160
I've heard her voice.
You don't sound like Mary.

511
20:42:57,100 --> 20:42:58,606
I am Mary. I'm Mary. I'm Mary.

512
20:42:58,675 --> 20:43:00,440
Show me your wallet.

513
20:43:03,900 --> 20:43:05,540
Now!

514
20:43:12,580 --> 20:43:14,380
What are you doing?

515
20:43:28,003 --> 20:43:30,467
So I've got bullets, but no gun.

516
20:43:31,431 --> 20:43:33,145
That's quite Zen.

517
20:43:39,420 --> 20:43:41,013
You're Erin Grey.

518
20:43:44,540 --> 20:43:46,057
D... don't.

519
20:43:55,020 --> 20:43:56,220
Find me a nail.

520
20:43:56,224 --> 20:43:58,163
W... what kind of nail?

521
20:43:58,220 --> 20:44:00,234
A nail nail. As in, a hammer and...

522
20:44:00,420 --> 20:44:01,541
Ok.

523
20:44:35,609 --> 20:44:37,060
- Mary?
- Yeah?

524
20:44:37,123 --> 20:44:38,987
Is the door locked?

525
20:45:04,791 --> 20:45:06,993
Stop! Stop, stop, stop.

526
20:45:09,180 --> 20:45:10,635
Police officer, open the door.

527
20:45:10,755 --> 20:45:13,431
Come on, come on. Get out.

528
20:45:41,860 --> 20:45:43,493
Give me the nail.

529
20:45:44,732 --> 20:45:47,322
Shh. Breathe, Tinkerbell.

530
20:45:47,384 --> 20:45:48,967
I don't know who you are.

531
20:45:49,368 --> 20:45:50,513
Open the door.

532
20:45:50,519 --> 20:45:51,658
- What?
- Gently.

533
20:45:55,981 --> 20:45:57,426
Close.

534
20:46:00,636 --> 20:46:02,751
Lean all your weight on the door.

535
20:46:40,744 --> 20:46:43,378
Nice try. Nice try, Mary.

536
20:46:47,010 --> 20:46:48,362
Tom!

537
20:46:48,681 --> 20:46:50,746
Isn't it time we knocked this on the head?

538
20:46:52,097 --> 20:46:54,868
Both of you. Move. Move! Move!

539
20:46:54,881 --> 20:46:56,589
Hey! Come on!

540
20:46:57,002 --> 20:46:59,574
Come on. Move it! Move it!

541
20:47:10,420 --> 20:47:13,688
Mary, it's going to be all right, ok?

542
20:47:18,100 --> 20:47:19,112
Tom,

543
20:47:19,794 --> 20:47:21,421
where's Natalie Green?

544
20:47:35,780 --> 20:47:38,311
Well, I'm going to be dead in a moment,

545
20:47:38,354 --> 20:47:40,770
so I suppose you're going to have
to live with the never knowing.

546
20:47:40,814 --> 20:47:44,180
No, don't punish me by hurting
Natalie, ok? She's done nothing.

547
20:47:44,300 --> 20:47:45,800
Who the hell do you think you are?

548
20:47:46,140 --> 20:47:47,665
To walk in here,

549
20:47:47,715 --> 20:47:49,216
after what you've done to me,

550
20:47:49,220 --> 20:47:51,751
and dictate what I can and can't do?

551
20:47:52,439 --> 20:47:56,000
No! Tom, don't. Stop, don't.

552
20:48:03,980 --> 20:48:05,780
You can choose, you can have one.

553
20:48:05,900 --> 20:48:07,211
Sorry?

554
20:48:07,211 --> 20:48:09,019
I said pick one.

555
20:48:14,620 --> 20:48:16,852
- Why?
- So you know what it feels like.

556
20:48:19,540 --> 20:48:21,660
Time's running out.

557
20:48:23,540 --> 20:48:25,979
Please don't do this.

558
20:48:25,980 --> 20:48:27,819
- It's your last chance.
- I can't.

559
20:48:29,095 --> 20:48:30,809
I can't pick one.

560
20:48:31,060 --> 20:48:33,679
- Then you'll walk out of here alone.
- Tom.

561
20:48:33,799 --> 20:48:34,713
Please.

562
20:48:35,620 --> 20:48:37,065
Please.

563
20:48:40,780 --> 20:48:43,503
It's ugly, isn't it? Being impotent.

564
20:48:43,547 --> 20:48:45,180
Being degraded

565
20:48:46,481 --> 20:48:49,522
by a violent man that
you'll never get to punish.

566
20:48:54,060 --> 20:48:55,500
Now pick.

567
20:48:57,340 --> 20:48:58,710
No.

568
20:48:59,860 --> 20:49:01,037
Fine.

569
20:49:01,157 --> 20:49:01,957
Stop!

570
20:49:02,001 --> 20:49:05,142
Just stop pointing that
gun at her head. Stop.

571
20:49:05,340 --> 20:49:08,082
- Then choose.
- I can't choose one.

572
20:49:08,100 --> 20:49:08,915
Five.

573
20:49:09,221 --> 20:49:10,810
- Four.
- Please!

574
20:49:11,192 --> 20:49:12,499
Three.

575
20:49:13,060 --> 20:49:14,270
Two.

576
20:49:15,415 --> 20:49:17,259
- One!
- All right!

577
20:49:17,260 --> 20:49:18,820
All right!

578
20:49:23,220 --> 20:49:24,606
Have you chosen?

579
20:49:25,180 --> 20:49:26,108
Yes.

580
20:49:26,228 --> 20:49:27,341
Then say it.

581
20:49:28,586 --> 20:49:30,419
Say her name.

582
20:49:33,580 --> 20:49:35,500
Say it now!

583
20:49:42,460 --> 20:49:43,809
Alice.

584
20:49:46,237 --> 20:49:47,419
Say it again.

585
20:49:53,540 --> 20:49:55,885
- Shoot Alice.
- Say it again!

586
20:49:57,558 --> 20:49:58,784
Alice.

587
20:49:59,860 --> 20:50:00,379
No!

588
20:50:08,620 --> 20:50:09,563
Oops.

589
20:50:10,364 --> 20:50:11,778
Sorry,

590
20:50:12,179 --> 20:50:13,974
couldn't resist.

591
20:50:15,300 --> 20:50:17,791
Run! Run. Run. Get out of here. Run! Go on.

592
20:50:21,180 --> 20:50:22,980
Go!

593
20:50:24,773 --> 20:50:27,339
Now, if I let this go,

594
20:50:28,071 --> 20:50:31,443
you'll die. Which is
what you want, isn't it?

595
20:50:31,487 --> 20:50:35,116
- Eh? But if I apply pressure just here...
- No.

596
20:50:35,500 --> 20:50:37,280
- There's a good chance you'll live.
- No!

597
20:50:37,487 --> 20:50:39,670
Please. Please. Don't. Please.

598
20:50:39,683 --> 20:50:41,679
- Please.
- Beg me.

599
20:50:42,098 --> 20:50:44,056
- Beg me!
- I'm begging you.

600
20:50:44,100 --> 20:50:47,099
Then where's Natalie? Where is she?

601
20:50:47,100 --> 20:50:49,659
- Please.
- Come on, Tom. Come on, Tom.

602
20:50:49,660 --> 20:50:50,551
The medics are coming,

603
20:50:50,563 --> 20:50:52,459
- they're going to save your life.
- No.

604
20:50:55,630 --> 20:50:58,339
She's in, she's in Cathay Street.

605
20:50:58,902 --> 20:51:01,155
- How do I know you're not lying?
- No. It's true. It's true.

606
20:51:01,186 --> 20:51:04,621
- How do I know? Is it true?
- Please. Just let go. Please.

607
20:51:06,340 --> 20:51:08,100
- You're ready to go?
- Yeah,

608
20:51:08,100 --> 20:51:10,470
I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready.

609
20:51:11,659 --> 20:51:13,449
Please...

610
20:51:14,287 --> 20:51:15,883
Not on your nelly.

611
20:51:16,380 --> 20:51:17,653
Medic!

612
20:51:18,122 --> 20:51:19,743
- No!
- Medic!

613
20:51:23,530 --> 20:51:26,427
I need him alive, put
pressure right here. Here!

614
20:51:39,180 --> 20:51:40,579
All right, upstairs.

615
20:51:40,580 --> 20:51:41,478
Sir.

616
20:51:58,580 --> 20:52:00,023
Natalie?

617
20:52:05,369 --> 20:52:07,300
We're the police.

618
20:52:12,500 --> 20:52:14,157
You're safe now.

619
20:52:31,180 --> 20:52:33,205
Hold on, hold on.

620
20:52:51,900 --> 20:52:53,120
Boss.

621
20:52:53,460 --> 20:52:55,090
What's happening?

622
20:52:55,300 --> 20:52:57,186
They arrested Alice Morgan.

623
20:52:57,643 --> 20:52:59,340
Where is she?

624
20:53:02,700 --> 20:53:05,062
- And Mary?
- She left you a message.

625
20:53:09,980 --> 20:53:11,499
She gave you this?

626
20:53:11,500 --> 20:53:13,172
She put it into my hand herself.

627
20:53:15,940 --> 20:53:17,660
Benny, I appreciate it, pal.

628
20:53:22,500 --> 20:53:24,390
Where you going, boss? She went that way.

629
20:53:24,700 --> 20:53:26,620
I just want to say sorry to Alice.

630
20:53:49,660 --> 20:53:54,363
There's been a mix up over who's who.

631
20:53:54,921 --> 20:53:56,448
I expect they'll, er,

632
20:53:57,643 --> 20:54:00,421
they'll work it out in a couple hours.

633
20:54:03,136 --> 20:54:05,908
I don't care what she's done,

634
20:54:06,865 --> 20:54:08,010
John.

635
20:54:09,348 --> 20:54:10,969
She saved my life.

636
20:54:16,740 --> 20:54:18,441
So you should probably...

637
20:54:18,829 --> 20:54:19,980
go.

638
20:54:22,540 --> 20:54:23,934
Yeah.

639
20:54:24,660 --> 20:54:25,818
Yeah.

640
20:54:26,260 --> 20:54:27,540
I should do that.

641
20:54:39,460 --> 20:54:41,790
- I...
- I know.

642
20:54:43,540 --> 20:54:44,849
Me too.

643
20:54:59,260 --> 20:55:01,260
Go on. Go.

644
20:56:51,060 --> 20:56:53,419
It was clever. The choice you made.

645
20:56:57,940 --> 20:56:59,237
Marwood?

646
20:57:00,075 --> 20:57:01,226
Alive.

647
20:57:01,558 --> 20:57:03,084
Suffering.

648
20:57:03,585 --> 20:57:05,168
Good.

649
20:57:13,620 --> 20:57:16,040
You really do need to lose the coat.

650
20:57:46,780 --> 20:57:47,941
So...

651
20:57:48,523 --> 20:57:50,060
now what?
