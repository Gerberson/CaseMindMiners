1
00:00:00,938 --> 00:00:02,385
Don't move.

2
00:00:03,801 --> 00:00:05,975
- This is my mate, Justin.
- Hey there.

3
00:00:05,991 --> 00:00:07,279
- Hey.
- And I love him.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,642
All I want is what you want.

5
00:00:09,658 --> 00:00:11,011
To have these people locked up,

6
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:12,911
so they can't do any more harm

7
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:13,928
to anyone else.

8
00:00:13,928 --> 00:00:16,094
Justin, I think I may
have taken a wrong turn.

9
00:00:16,214 --> 00:00:17,323
Do you want to talk about this properly?

10
00:00:17,362 --> 00:00:19,810
- That's why I'm here.
- No, I mean, properly.

11
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,171
I'm not sure what's
supposed to be going on here.

12
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,666
I'm completely lost.

13
00:00:24,713 --> 00:00:25,886
That's why we're here.

14
00:00:25,894 --> 00:00:29,695
To help you understand
how lost you really are.

15
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,699
How am I supposed to trust
you if you don't trust me?

16
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,580
I will be back.

17
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,019
I'm a copper, we're on the same side.

18
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,276
I don't think you're going to shoot me.

19
00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:42,552
I warned you not to make me your enemy!

20
00:00:42,672 --> 00:00:45,876
- I warned you!
- No. Don't you... don't you...

21
00:00:45,907 --> 00:00:48,180
Hey. Get up!

22
00:01:00,055 --> 00:01:01,940
Justin.

23
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:20,860
Please.

24
00:02:42,626 --> 00:02:44,778
Oh, God. Key. Key. Key.

25
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,705
Are you ok? You ok?

26
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,580
Mary.

27
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,384
What did John say to you exactly?

28
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:24,856
He said... he said he was busy.

29
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,020
And that I should meet
him here, at his place.

30
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,551
No.

31
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,086
Erin?

32
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,020
Man down.

33
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,060
Justin Ripley.

34
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:21,619
So what is it with John Luther

35
00:06:22,345 --> 00:06:24,359
and the people he loves?

36
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,430
John, I don't know what to say.

37
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:51,395
I don't have the words.

38
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,134
Where is Mary?

39
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,731
John Luther,

40
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,355
you're under arrest for the murder
of Detective Sergeant Justin Ripley

41
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,702
and the attempted murder of Mary Day.

42
00:07:32,224 --> 00:07:34,821
Mary! Hey, Mary. Mary!

43
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:36,579
Hold on!

44
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:49,289
Ok.

45
00:08:49,546 --> 00:08:52,411
From this side of the table, it looks like

46
00:08:52,993 --> 00:08:55,477
there's two people who
could incriminate you,

47
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,679
one of which is now dead

48
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:01,670
by the hand of Tom Marwood.

49
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,361
And Mary Day would be...
had I not intervened.

50
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:08,208
And you're welcome, by the way.

51
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,500
You told her where to go, John.

52
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,537
You told her where

53
00:09:18,681 --> 00:09:19,720
and when.

54
00:09:20,903 --> 00:09:24,250
And I think you did that
because you wanted Marwood

55
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,628
to kill her for you.

56
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,021
Yesterday,

57
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,456
a few hours before he shot
and killed Justin Ripley,

58
00:09:35,481 --> 00:09:37,615
you spoke for some time to Mr Marwood.

59
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,600
Your report notes that
during this conversation,

60
00:09:40,618 --> 00:09:43,420
Tom Marwood asked for more time.

61
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:47,540
"Give me two days."

62
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:52,081
And then you let him go.

63
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,093
Which makes me wonder,
what was the quid pro quo?

64
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,269
Shut your mouth.

65
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,108
You let Marwood

66
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:04,995
run free to kill his paedophiles and his

67
00:10:05,195 --> 00:10:07,104
scumbags.

68
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,076
That's no skin off your nose.

69
00:10:11,107 --> 00:10:12,715
No humans involved.

70
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,504
But then in exchange,

71
00:10:14,554 --> 00:10:16,000
does you a favour.

72
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,700
He cleans up your mess.

73
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:31,415
I loved him.

74
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,879
He's got too many friends.

75
00:10:59,085 --> 00:11:00,706
We'll have to move him.

76
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,659
What is this, John?

77
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:36,618
I don't know, George.

78
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:38,532
Stay here.

79
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,519
Erin!

80
00:12:26,818 --> 00:12:28,540
Wotcher.

81
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,457
'Detective Ripley has been hailed
a hero by his colleagues after

82
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,029
'he was shot point blank in the
chest by vigilante Thomas Marwood

83
00:12:39,035 --> 00:12:41,113
'who has been branded a coward... '

84
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,424
Oh.

85
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:05,503
If you're going to go on the
run you're going to have to, er,

86
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:07,092
lose the coat.

87
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,407
It's my lucky coat.

88
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,383
Lucky?!

89
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:14,224
Right. Well, I would take it
back to the shop, if I was you.

90
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,946
Get your money back.
It's obviously defective.

91
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,662
This is a nice place.

92
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,939
Is it yours?

93
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,700
Don't be silly.

94
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,075
Alice, what are you doing here?

95
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,780
I saw the news.

96
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:37,873
Where have you been?

97
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,462
Berlin.

98
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,994
I don't believe you.

99
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,300
Oh, you should.

100
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,316
I assumed you'd need it, eventually.

101
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,620
Not yet.

102
00:13:58,195 --> 00:13:59,759
After Marwood.

103
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:01,880
Then I'm done.

104
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:04,220
Why? Because he killed your puppy?

105
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,786
Oh, that's why you're here?

106
00:14:08,962 --> 00:14:10,589
To rub my nose in it?

107
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,908
No.

108
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:15,606
I came to help the people you love.

109
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:16,744
I'm sorry?

110
00:14:16,794 --> 00:14:19,272
You assert this fabulous
moral conscience, John.

111
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:23,019
This adherence to unwritten
law. Yet, time and again,

112
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:27,300
it devastates the people you claim
to hold dear, but you don't stop.

113
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:32,342
It seems to me your conscience
has killed more people than I have.

114
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,251
Well, you know, you say "escape," George,

115
00:14:58,288 --> 00:15:01,980
but to me, this looks more like
the scene of a violent abduction.

116
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,665
By Marwood?

117
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,341
Presumably.

118
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:08,812
Why not pop him here?

119
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:11,133
The way he did Ripley?

120
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,942
Well, we won't know that
until we ask him, will we?

121
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:15,244
In the meantime,

122
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:16,708
somewhere out there,

123
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:18,297
there is a police officer

124
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,637
in the hands of a known police killer.

125
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:22,464
Well, either way, Martin...

126
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:25,180
we both want DCI Luther

127
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:26,444
returned to us

128
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,357
at the earliest opportunity.

129
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:30,404
A search is under way.

130
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:31,881
Then widen it.

131
00:15:34,064 --> 00:15:35,090
You know, George,

132
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:38,412
the Tom Marwood investigation
is under my command,

133
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,052
and God help you

134
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,309
if you interfere with it

135
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:43,668
or question my allocation of resources.

136
00:15:44,362 --> 00:15:47,040
DCI Luther does have some loyal friends,

137
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:49,540
- doesn't he?
- Oh, yes, he does.

138
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,229
'One officer was shot dead
and another badly injured.

139
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,728
'In what the police say
may be a related incident,

140
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:05,019
'Milan Knizac has been
attacked in Mortlake Prison.

141
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,299
'Knizac is serving a life sentence

00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,169

'less than halfway through

146
00:16:22,486 --> 00:16:24,629
- What do you want?
- Don't move!

147
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,854
So where are we going?

148
00:16:42,873 --> 00:16:44,738
We're taking you somewhere safe,

149
00:16:44,925 --> 00:16:46,158
just to be sure.

150
00:16:46,683 --> 00:16:49,620
But you can't honestly think
John would ever hurt me?

151
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,989
So where did you go?

152
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,337
Oh, here and there. Got married.

153
00:17:48,012 --> 00:17:49,419
- You got what?
- Married.

154
00:17:49,626 --> 00:17:50,571
Why?

155
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,762
Does it add a tingle of the
illicit to the conversation?

156
00:17:53,882 --> 00:17:58,016
It adds a tingle of
disbelief, is what it does.

157
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,006
- Erm, where did you and...
- Bertrand.

158
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:03,939
A conference in Sao Paolo.

159
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:06,755
Oh, he was intensely intellectual.

160
00:18:07,425 --> 00:18:09,932
- He "was"?
- Sadly, he passed away.

161
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:12,854
Some little girls grow up wanting ponies.

162
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:15,864
I always wanted to be a widow.

163
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:20,769
So, what about you?

164
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,336
Have you found someone, hmm?

165
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,292
Yeah. Kind of.

166
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,677
And is she interesting?

167
00:18:33,797 --> 00:18:35,291
- To whom?
- Me!

168
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,356
- I don't know.
- Well,

169
00:18:37,476 --> 00:18:39,351
I imagine she wouldn't be, terribly.

170
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:41,760
She wouldn't be some kind of Zoe surrogate.

171
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:45,060
You've got enough self-knowledge
to avoid that trap.

172
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:50,900
So she's a pixie.

173
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,204
- A what?
- A pixie.

174
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,139
A sprite.

175
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,291
A daydream of the life you
imagine you want to live.

176
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,414
Oh, dear, I feel a bit sorry for her.

177
00:19:01,457 --> 00:19:02,746
You don't feel sorry for anyone.

178
00:19:02,803 --> 00:19:03,973
Well, quite.

179
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:05,937
But in principle, I pity her.

180
00:19:05,962 --> 00:19:08,152
She's not what you want.

181
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,260
She's what you want to want.

182
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:12,220
What is it I want exactly?

183
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:17,324
We're not talking about that.

184
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:19,095
We're talking about Pixie.

185
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:21,179
- Pix... her name is Mary.
- I know.

186
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,940
'The officer shot dead
last night has been named

187
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,501
'as Detective Sergeant Justin Ripley.

188
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,367
'Detective Sergeant Ripley is
believed to have been killed

189
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,810
'by Tom Marwood who first appealed to
the public in this video yesterday.'

190
00:19:44,592 --> 00:19:45,887
'Four years ago,

191
00:19:46,007 --> 00:19:48,927
'she was raped and murdered
by a man called Milan Knizac.'

192
00:19:49,328 --> 00:19:50,817
This him?

193
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,624
This is him.

194
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,723
Goodness gracious me.
What a needy little fishy.

195
00:19:57,754 --> 00:19:59,712
Oh, he's got a hero complex.

196
00:20:00,457 --> 00:20:03,691
He needs public opinion to
justify his own actions to himself.

197
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,691
So what's the plan, Stan?

198
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,139
I take away everything he wants.

199
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,115
What does he want?

200
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:15,560
To avenge his wife.

201
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,862
To be admired. To become a martyr.

202
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,227
All to make his wife's
death mean something.

203
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:22,500
You'd take all that from him?

204
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,853
Yeah.

205
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,060
That's cruel.

206
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,314
It's the cruellest thing I can think of.

207
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,924
Ok.

208
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,627
But if any police

209
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:40,040
aren't out there looking for him,

210
00:20:40,078 --> 00:20:41,961
they're out there looking for you. So...

211
00:20:43,482 --> 00:20:45,409
how do we even begin?

212
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:46,479
Well.

213
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,737
First step.

214
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:50,539
You're Thomas Marwood.

215
00:20:50,552 --> 00:20:52,253
You want to kill the man
that killed your wife.

216
00:20:52,373 --> 00:20:54,737
But Milan Knizac is in prison.

217
00:20:54,793 --> 00:20:57,646
So how would you do it?

218
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,374
With leverage.

219
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:03,077
Give me a lever long enough

220
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,305
and a fulcrum on which to place it,

221
00:21:05,425 --> 00:21:06,462
and...

222
00:21:08,127 --> 00:21:10,072
I can move the world.

223
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,868
Nat?

224
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,326
Nat?!

225
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,815
Hello?

226
00:21:57,853 --> 00:21:59,160
It's not an easy thing, is it,

227
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,156
when your wife is taken from you?

228
00:22:01,638 --> 00:22:03,445
Well, do as I tell you

229
00:22:03,996 --> 00:22:05,366
and you'll get her back.

230
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,020
What is this place?

231
00:22:38,406 --> 00:22:40,177
Nobody knows we're here, Mary.

232
00:22:40,471 --> 00:22:41,835
Not John,

233
00:22:41,955 --> 00:22:42,936
none of his friends.

234
00:22:42,949 --> 00:22:44,957
So, as long as we stay here,

235
00:22:45,201 --> 00:22:46,546
we're safe, ok?

236
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:50,020
Just... try and make yourself comfortable.

237
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,846
Benny.

238
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,060
Schenk.

239
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,335
Well, never let it be said

240
00:23:45,373 --> 00:23:48,540
that you are less than
audacious, Miss Morgan.

241
00:23:48,576 --> 00:23:52,048
Well, I've got an issue
with impulse control, Martin.

242
00:23:52,168 --> 00:23:54,545
It's in the genes apparently.

243
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:58,223
You know, Miss Morgan, I must
remind you, I'm a police officer

244
00:23:58,448 --> 00:24:01,570
and you are a fugitive from justice.

245
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,054
And that, by walking in here,

246
00:24:03,073 --> 00:24:06,595
you have, by default,
surrendered your liberty.

247
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,692
Well, you're entitled to send me back.

248
00:24:10,124 --> 00:24:11,462
I wouldn't take it personally.

249
00:24:11,462 --> 00:24:13,671
- Besides, I'd only escape.
- I have no doubt.

250
00:24:13,677 --> 00:24:15,328
Meanwhile, John will be in prison.

251
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:16,379
Or dead

252
00:24:17,174 --> 00:24:18,807
at the hands of Tom Marwood.

253
00:24:21,234 --> 00:24:23,617
Now, me, I'm as guilty as sin.

254
00:24:24,043 --> 00:24:25,732
Name it, I've done it.

255
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:26,551
But...

256
00:24:26,952 --> 00:24:30,474
John's as innocent as I am culpable.

257
00:24:30,912 --> 00:24:34,171
So I suppose the question I'm
here to ask is which matters more?

258
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:36,205
Punishing my guilt?

259
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:38,977
Or proving John's innocence?

260
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,728
Now John

261
00:24:41,404 --> 00:24:43,843
has asked me to tell you that Tom Marwood

262
00:24:43,963 --> 00:24:46,609
won't allow himself to be arrested.

263
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,924
He intends to commit suicide by cop,

264
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,926
to die a martyr to his own cause.

265
00:24:52,046 --> 00:24:54,792
Now John knows how to bring him in alive.

266
00:24:54,836 --> 00:24:55,887
But...

267
00:24:56,644 --> 00:24:58,302
he's going to need

268
00:24:59,053 --> 00:25:00,210
your support.

269
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,780
What exactly does he need?

270
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,781
For starters,

271
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:12,566
anything you have on Milan Knizac.

272
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,505
Oh,

273
00:25:13,943 --> 00:25:17,490
and I'm going to need a personnel file.

274
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,300
Thank you, boys.

275
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,038
Why did you come back?

276
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,172
I beg your pardon?

277
00:25:36,292 --> 00:25:37,736
You heard.

278
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,713
I told you. I saw the news.

279
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:42,215
Alice, come on.

280
00:25:42,571 --> 00:25:44,317
None of this Berlin bullshit.

281
00:25:44,924 --> 00:25:46,463
You've been in London for weeks.

282
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,796
What makes you say that?

283
00:25:47,821 --> 00:25:50,361
I saw a receipt for those boots.

284
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,087
I wanted something.

285
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:58,870
- What?
- You.

286
00:26:04,756 --> 00:26:07,872
- Alice, Mary and I...
- Oh, do be serious.

287
00:26:08,923 --> 00:26:11,313
You'll be bored silly
by the end of the week.

288
00:26:11,826 --> 00:26:13,803
- You and I are...
- What?

289
00:26:16,725 --> 00:26:18,058
Well...

290
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,152
- What do I do?
- Let me have it, please.

291
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,336
Erin, no. Leave it, it's fine.

292
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:37,202
If it's him, it's important we know

293
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,098
what he says. Ok.

294
00:26:39,955 --> 00:26:40,975
Answer.

295
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,546
Hello?

296
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,704
'Mary.

297
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:46,418
Where are you?'

298
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,222
I can't tell you that, John.

299
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,418
They...

300
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,263
they won't let me tell you.

301
00:26:53,383 --> 00:26:55,816
All right. Ok, of course they won't.

302
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,393
Look, I won't be long, ok?

303
00:26:57,393 --> 00:26:58,625
I just want to tell you something

304
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,703
and I want you to hear
me say it, all right?

305
00:27:00,823 --> 00:27:04,219
I haven't done any of the
things they're saying I did.

306
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:09,031
Are you ok?

307
00:27:09,243 --> 00:27:10,563
Yeah.

308
00:27:10,858 --> 00:27:13,335
Hi, yeah, we've got a trace on DCI Luther.

309
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,593
Well, look, don't be scared.

310
00:27:14,612 --> 00:27:16,945
George Stark's a bit of a dick

311
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:18,922
but he means well, I guess.

312
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,775
And Erin Grey, well, she just...

313
00:27:22,194 --> 00:27:24,077
she's got me all wrong, all right.

314
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:26,386
But she's a good woman and...

315
00:27:27,056 --> 00:27:28,826
when push comes to shove, you can,

316
00:27:29,402 --> 00:27:31,285
- well, you can trust her.
- Ok.

317
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,724
Are they with you now?

318
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,567
What about you? Are you, um...

319
00:27:40,731 --> 00:27:41,826
Ok?

320
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,866
Yeah.

321
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,580
Yeah.

322
00:28:05,202 --> 00:28:06,860
Benny...

323
00:28:13,363 --> 00:28:15,177
Guv, can I have a word?

324
00:28:15,534 --> 00:28:17,660
- Huh?
- Now, please.

325
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:29,905
What the hell was that?

326
00:28:30,287 --> 00:28:31,588
Letting her talk to him?

327
00:28:31,632 --> 00:28:33,140
What if he traces the call?

328
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,556
Oh, my God.

329
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,580
You're trying to lure
him here! Are you mad?

330
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,618
- How is she?
- Safe.

331
00:29:20,905 --> 00:29:22,488
Did you find anyone?

332
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:26,261
It'll be in one of these.

333
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,755
Ok. Ok.

334
00:29:33,224 --> 00:29:36,578
Oh, I'm bored of this already. Ok.

335
00:29:36,822 --> 00:29:38,812
Milan Knizac is in the prison hospital

336
00:29:38,824 --> 00:29:39,925
because someone cut his throat.

337
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,503
Joe Green has got access to him.

338
00:29:42,534 --> 00:29:43,820
He's a prison doctor.

339
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,025
He's also married to Natalie
Green, who's pregnant.

340
00:29:46,088 --> 00:29:48,096
So that's who I'd go for,

341
00:29:48,115 --> 00:29:49,635
if I wanted Milan Knizac dead.

342
00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:52,645
And I needed leverage.

343
00:30:13,785 --> 00:30:15,739
- Who are you?
- Police.

344
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,639
He said no police! No police!

345
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:20,692
Just stay there, just stay there.

346
00:30:22,694 --> 00:30:24,727
Alice, Marwood's gone.

347
00:30:25,015 --> 00:30:27,672
We missed him, all right. He's long gone.

348
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,740
All right, so what did he say exactly?

349
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,393
That I should report to work tomorrow

350
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,539
and kill Milan Knizac
with a lethal injection.

351
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,780
And if you don't?

352
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,980
He'll make sure that what Knizac
did to his wife is done to mine.

353
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,581
- He said that if I called the police...
- I'm not police.

354
00:31:01,313 --> 00:31:02,940
I was the police. But I'm not any more.

355
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:04,148
Who the hell are you then?

356
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:06,900
I'm the man that's going
to bring Natalie back.

357
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,429
Where are you going? You
can't just leave me here!

358
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:12,969
If I take you with me,
you'll do something stupid.

359
00:31:13,089 --> 00:31:15,490
You won't be able to help
yourself. You love Natalie, right?

360
00:31:17,236 --> 00:31:19,106
What about him? Tom
Marwood? What about him?

361
00:31:19,094 --> 00:31:21,060
He won't know what hit him.

362
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,614
Benny, small change of plans.

363
00:31:26,734 --> 00:31:29,091
I need you to get a
trace on the last number

364
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:30,849
who called this phone.

365
00:31:31,337 --> 00:31:32,489
Yeah.

366
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,140
Hello.

367
00:32:17,434 --> 00:32:18,798
This is

368
00:32:19,311 --> 00:32:20,775
Ryan Clark.

369
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,690
He was over the limit,

370
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:25,536
high on meth,

371
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:28,990
he was banned from driving and behind

372
00:32:29,318 --> 00:32:30,982
the wheel of a stolen car

373
00:32:31,026 --> 00:32:33,229
when he ran over and killed

374
00:32:34,236 --> 00:32:35,919
a 12-year-old boy.

375
00:32:38,178 --> 00:32:41,037
Mr Clark then fled the scene.

376
00:32:41,575 --> 00:32:44,979
He was in prison for less than five years.

377
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,907
This is not about Ryan Clark's rights...

378
00:32:48,027 --> 00:32:50,419
this is about our responsibilities.

379
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,776
This is about us doing for ourselves

380
00:32:52,832 --> 00:32:55,316
what the state refuses to do for us.

381
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,702
People like me have tried to be reasonable,

382
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,998
we have tried to be reasonable
but nobody's listened.

383
00:33:03,118 --> 00:33:04,575
Oh, boy.

384
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,978
He really does need the
world to love him, doesn't he?

385
00:33:08,016 --> 00:33:10,694
So now a 12-year-old boy is dead.

386
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,222
My wife is dead.

387
00:33:14,135 --> 00:33:17,157
Many other people are dead.

388
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,780
Well, no more.

389
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:27,243
I have a list of people like Ryan Clark

390
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:29,545
and I will execute them

391
00:33:29,665 --> 00:33:31,729
at a rate of one a day,

392
00:33:32,142 --> 00:33:34,776
every day, until the Prime Minister agrees

393
00:33:34,776 --> 00:33:36,521
to hold a referendum

394
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:40,300
on the death penalty. Now,
that's all I'm asking for,

395
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,021
is for the people of this country

396
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:44,460
to be given a choice.

397
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,763
It's not like you gave
Justin Ripley a choice, is it?

398
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,773
That man's death is on your head.

399
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:53,144
Well, I don't see how that can be right.

400
00:33:53,162 --> 00:33:54,658
I didn't ask you to kill him.

401
00:33:54,677 --> 00:33:56,260
I warned you to stay away.

402
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,676
You can't hold me accountable
if you choose not to listen.

403
00:33:59,676 --> 00:34:01,784
See, the thing is, I
can hold you accountable.

404
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,861
Me being a copper and all that.

405
00:34:15,661 --> 00:34:18,033
- What... g... give me that camera.
- Oh, I don't think so.

406
00:34:18,045 --> 00:34:20,448
Give me that camera or I will shoot him!

407
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,737
No, you won't, Thomas.

408
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,669
Not on camera,

409
00:34:24,057 --> 00:34:27,220
because people do hate a cop killer

410
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,256
and you so very much want to be admired,

411
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:32,579
which is a defect, really,
in a multiple murderer but...

412
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,093
- Do not move another step.
- She's got a point there, Tom.

413
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,652
I mean, you're not going to
shoot an innocent man, a cop.

414
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,219
Not for the world to see.

415
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,257
Turn off the camera!
Turn off that camera now!

416
00:34:41,263 --> 00:34:44,780
Why don't you just stop
all this, all right?

417
00:34:44,804 --> 00:34:47,425
And tell us where you're
keeping Natalie Green.

418
00:34:47,494 --> 00:34:50,260
Who has she ever hurt in her life? No-one.

419
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,668
Not to mention the fact

420
00:34:51,693 --> 00:34:53,239
- that she's pregnant.
- Shut up!

421
00:34:53,714 --> 00:34:55,816
- Shut up!
- Come on, Tom. Come on!

422
00:34:55,936 --> 00:34:57,487
Just let her go.

423
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,820
You being the... the
defender of the innocent.

424
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,076
Stop, stop! Turn it off!

425
00:35:05,101 --> 00:35:08,048
Whoever the hell you
are, turn off that camera.

426
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,607
Tell her to turn it off.

427
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,292
Look. Look, just put it down. Put it down.

428
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:15,300
Put it down and turn it
off. Do as the man says.

429
00:35:15,344 --> 00:35:17,321
You hear me, do it, do it, do it.

430
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,700
Now move away, move away.

431
00:35:31,218 --> 00:35:33,608
Oh, what are you going
to do now, DCI Luther?

432
00:35:33,646 --> 00:35:35,091
What are you going to do now, Tom?

433
00:35:35,211 --> 00:35:36,593
She's not going to come back, you know.

434
00:35:36,606 --> 00:35:38,864
- I don't care if she does. I've got the camera.
- Problem is,

435
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,055
the world is going to see that

436
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:42,894
you're not actually a hero.

437
00:35:42,938 --> 00:35:45,535
You're just a cop killer

438
00:35:45,655 --> 00:35:48,744
that would kidnap a pregnant woman.

439
00:35:48,756 --> 00:35:50,646
I mean, come on, that's nasty!

440
00:35:50,646 --> 00:35:53,192
She's gone, Tom. There's
no point running after her.

441
00:35:53,261 --> 00:35:54,881
She's gone.

442
00:36:05,404 --> 00:36:06,380
Bingo.

443
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:08,345
You, you! Bring her back!

444
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:10,334
- Bring her back!
- Tom,

445
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:12,242
it's not like I can actually

446
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:14,819
show the tape to anyone really.

447
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,921
W... why not? Why not?

448
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,111
Let's say I did. What do you stand to lose?

449
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:21,683
You... you still can kill Natalie Green.

450
00:36:21,715 --> 00:36:23,542
I don't have her, you do.

451
00:36:23,998 --> 00:36:26,464
So, er, I've got what you want.

452
00:36:26,514 --> 00:36:28,591
And you've got what I want.

453
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,002
So what do we do now?

454
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,098
You take me to Natalie.

455
00:36:36,218 --> 00:36:37,781
All right, you let her go.

456
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:41,822
What and then you, you
give me back the tape?

457
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,980
Give it right back.

458
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,844
Liar.

459
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,385
See, you forgot

460
00:37:02,067 --> 00:37:05,101
that I had stolen...

461
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,356
I stole your phone, remember?

462
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:13,811
So I have heard all those
lovely, intimate messages from...

463
00:37:14,956 --> 00:37:16,357
Mary Day, was it?

464
00:37:24,157 --> 00:37:25,314
So,

465
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,567
you get me that tape,

466
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,569
and I give you back

467
00:37:29,689 --> 00:37:30,876
your Mary.

468
00:37:32,178 --> 00:37:33,480
Ok?

469
00:38:37,155 --> 00:38:38,357
I'm a police officer.

470
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,696
Give us that phone, I need that phone.

471
00:38:39,746 --> 00:38:42,386
- What are you doing?
- I just need this phone.

472
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,227
Hello?

473
00:38:46,227 --> 00:38:47,723
Put George on the phone now.

474
00:38:47,923 --> 00:38:49,468
On speaker. Just do it!

475
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,652
Ok. Ok. You're on speaker.

476
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,300
You have to get Mary
out of there right now!

477
00:38:56,425 --> 00:38:57,633
Do you understand me?

478
00:38:57,651 --> 00:38:58,834
I think we've had enough of that.

479
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,213
What are you doing?

480
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,584
George?

481
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,817
He's trying to lure us out of here.

482
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,420
Please, trust me.

483
00:39:09,464 --> 00:39:12,298
Boss, you need to get
C019 down to Paragon...

484
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:13,962
Paragon Towers right now.

485
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,060
Get them there.

486
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,860
Hello, Tinkerbell.

487
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,656
It's John.

488
00:40:10,513 --> 00:40:12,696
There's nothing to worry about.

489
00:40:14,624 --> 00:40:17,057
We need you to stay here, ok?

490
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,944
- Who the hell are you?
- Shh.

491
00:40:54,312 --> 00:40:55,607
What's that?

492
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,490
Proof you shouldn't need

493
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,967
of the kind of man John Luther actually is.

494
00:41:22,853 --> 00:41:24,736
When Stark and the lesbian get back,

495
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,712
you show them this.

496
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,676
Oh, and if you ever

497
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:29,365
betray him like this again...

498
00:41:31,505 --> 00:41:33,860
I'll kill you and eat you.

499
00:41:39,101 --> 00:41:40,853
How does that sound?

500
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:27,942
What's your name?

501
00:42:27,961 --> 00:42:29,362
What?

502
00:42:29,482 --> 00:42:31,295
What's your name?

503
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,380
Are you Mary?

504
00:42:36,434 --> 00:42:37,655
Are you Mary?!

505
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:40,245
Yes. Yes, yes, I'm Mary.

506
00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:42,585
Did John send you to do this?

507
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,687
To do what?

508
00:42:45,331 --> 00:42:47,828
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- John Luther.

509
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,551
I know what Mary sounds like.

510
00:42:53,177 --> 00:42:56,160
I've heard her voice.
You don't sound like Mary.

511
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,606
I am Mary. I'm Mary. I'm Mary.

512
00:42:58,675 --> 00:43:00,440
Show me your wallet.

513
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,540
Now!

514
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,380
What are you doing?

515
00:43:28,003 --> 00:43:30,467
So I've got bullets, but no gun.

516
00:43:31,431 --> 00:43:33,145
That's quite Zen.

517
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,013
You're Erin Grey.

518
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,057
D... don't.

519
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,220
Find me a nail.

520
00:43:56,224 --> 00:43:58,163
W... what kind of nail?

521
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,234
A nail nail. As in, a hammer and...

522
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,541
Ok.

523
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:37,060
- Mary?
- Yeah?

524
00:44:37,123 --> 00:44:38,987
Is the door locked?

525
00:45:04,791 --> 00:45:06,993
Stop! Stop, stop, stop.

526
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,635
Police officer, open the door.

527
00:45:10,755 --> 00:45:13,431
Come on, come on. Get out.

528
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,493
Give me the nail.

529
00:45:44,732 --> 00:45:47,322
Shh. Breathe, Tinkerbell.

530
00:45:47,384 --> 00:45:48,967
I don't know who you are.

531
00:45:49,368 --> 00:45:50,513
Open the door.

532
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:51,658
- What?
- Gently.

533
00:45:55,981 --> 00:45:57,426
Close.

534
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:02,751
Lean all your weight on the door.

535
00:46:40,744 --> 00:46:43,378
Nice try. Nice try, Mary.

536
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,362
Tom!

537
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:50,746
Isn't it time we knocked this on the head?

538
00:46:52,097 --> 00:46:54,868
Both of you. Move. Move! Move!

539
00:46:54,881 --> 00:46:56,589
Hey! Come on!

540
00:46:57,002 --> 00:46:59,574
Come on. Move it! Move it!

541
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,688
Mary, it's going to be all right, ok?

542
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,112
Tom,

543
00:47:19,794 --> 00:47:21,421
where's Natalie Green?

544
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:38,311
Well, I'm going to be dead in a moment,

545
00:47:38,354 --> 00:47:40,770
so I suppose you're going to have
to live with the never knowing.

546
00:47:40,814 --> 00:47:44,180
No, don't punish me by hurting
Natalie, ok? She's done nothing.

547
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,800
Who the hell do you think you are?

548
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,665
To walk in here,

549
00:47:47,715 --> 00:47:49,216
after what you've done to me,

550
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,751
and dictate what I can and can't do?

551
00:47:52,439 --> 00:47:56,000
No! Tom, don't. Stop, don't.

552
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,780
You can choose, you can have one.

553
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,211
Sorry?

554
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:09,019
I said pick one.

555
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,852
- Why?
- So you know what it feels like.

556
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,660
Time's running out.

557
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,979
Please don't do this.

558
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,819
- It's your last chance.
- I can't.

559
00:48:29,095 --> 00:48:30,809
I can't pick one.

560
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,679
- Then you'll walk out of here alone.
- Tom.

561
00:48:33,799 --> 00:48:34,713
Please.

562
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,065
Please.

563
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,503
It's ugly, isn't it? Being impotent.

564
00:48:43,547 --> 00:48:45,180
Being degraded

565
00:48:46,481 --> 00:48:49,522
by a violent man that
you'll never get to punish.

566
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,500
Now pick.

567
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,710
No.

568
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,037
Fine.

569
00:49:01,157 --> 00:49:01,957
Stop!

570
00:49:02,001 --> 00:49:05,142
Just stop pointing that
gun at her head. Stop.

571
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:08,082
- Then choose.
- I can't choose one.

572
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:08,915
Five.

573
00:49:09,221 --> 00:49:10,810
- Four.
- Please!

574
00:49:11,192 --> 00:49:12,499
Three.

575
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,270
Two.

576
00:49:15,415 --> 00:49:17,259
- One!
- All right!

577
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,820
All right!

578
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,606
Have you chosen?

579
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,108
Yes.

580
00:49:26,228 --> 00:49:27,341
Then say it.

581
00:49:28,586 --> 00:49:30,419
Say her name.

582
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,500
Say it now!

583
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:43,809
Alice.

584
00:49:46,237 --> 00:49:47,419
Say it again.

585
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:55,885
- Shoot Alice.
- Say it again!

586
00:49:57,558 --> 00:49:58,784
Alice.

587
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,379
No!

588
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,563
Oops.

589
00:50:10,364 --> 00:50:11,778
Sorry,

590
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:13,974
couldn't resist.

591
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,791
Run! Run. Run. Get out of here. Run! Go on.

592
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,980
Go!

593
00:50:24,773 --> 00:50:27,339
Now, if I let this go,

594
00:50:28,071 --> 00:50:31,443
you'll die. Which is
what you want, isn't it?

595
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:35,116
- Eh? But if I apply pressure just here...
- No.

596
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,280
- There's a good chance you'll live.
- No!

597
00:50:37,487 --> 00:50:39,670
Please. Please. Don't. Please.

598
00:50:39,683 --> 00:50:41,679
- Please.
- Beg me.

599
00:50:42,098 --> 00:50:44,056
- Beg me!
- I'm begging you.

600
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,099
Then where's Natalie? Where is she?

601
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,659
- Please.
- Come on, Tom. Come on, Tom.

602
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:50,551
The medics are coming,

603
00:50:50,563 --> 00:50:52,459
- they're going to save your life.
- No.

604
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:58,339
She's in, she's in Cathay Street.

605
00:50:58,902 --> 00:51:01,155
- How do I know you're not lying?
- No. It's true. It's true.

606
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:04,621
- How do I know? Is it true?
- Please. Just let go. Please.

607
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:08,100
- You're ready to go?
- Yeah,

608
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,470
I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready.

609
00:51:11,659 --> 00:51:13,449
Please...

610
00:51:14,287 --> 00:51:15,883
Not on your nelly.

611
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,653
Medic!

612
00:51:18,122 --> 00:51:19,743
- No!
- Medic!

613
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:26,427
I need him alive, put
pressure right here. Here!

614
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,579
All right, upstairs.

615
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:41,478
Sir.

616
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,023
Natalie?

617
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:07,300
We're the police.

618
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,157
You're safe now.

619
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,205
Hold on, hold on.

620
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,120
Boss.

621
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,090
What's happening?

622
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,186
They arrested Alice Morgan.

623
00:52:57,643 --> 00:52:59,340
Where is she?

624
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,062
- And Mary?
- She left you a message.

625
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,499
She gave you this?

626
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,172
She put it into my hand herself.

627
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,660
Benny, I appreciate it, pal.

628
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,390
Where you going, boss? She went that way.

629
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,620
I just want to say sorry to Alice.

630
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:54,363
There's been a mix up over who's who.

631
00:53:54,921 --> 00:53:56,448
I expect they'll, er,

632
00:53:57,643 --> 00:54:00,421
they'll work it out in a couple hours.

633
00:54:03,136 --> 00:54:05,908
I don't care what she's done,

634
00:54:06,865 --> 00:54:08,010
John.

635
00:54:09,348 --> 00:54:10,969
She saved my life.

636
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,441
So you should probably...

637
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:19,980
go.

638
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:23,934
Yeah.

639
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,818
Yeah.

640
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,540
I should do that.

641
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:41,790
- I...
- I know.

642
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:44,849
Me too.

643
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,260
Go on. Go.

644
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,419
It was clever. The choice you made.

645
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,237
Marwood?

646
00:57:00,075 --> 00:57:01,226
Alive.

647
00:57:01,558 --> 00:57:03,084
Suffering.

648
00:57:03,585 --> 00:57:05,168
Good.

649
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:16,040
You really do need to lose the coat.

650
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:47,941
So...

651
00:57:48,523 --> 00:57:50,060
now what?
