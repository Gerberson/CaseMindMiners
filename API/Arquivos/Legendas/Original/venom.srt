1
00:01:25,584 --> 00:01:27,419
Lights out!

2
00:01:28,587 --> 00:01:31,056
Cletus, are you there?

3
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,492
My angel.

4
00:01:34,393 --> 00:01:36,528
This is for you.

5
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,369
What did the doctor say?

6
00:01:43,502 --> 00:01:46,305
He said the mutations
are advancing.

7
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:48,374
My powers are too strong.

8
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:50,376
Cletus, I'm scared.

9
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,178
It's gonna be okay.

10
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:54,480
They're coming to take me away.

11
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:58,016
They're sending me to a place

12
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,085
where there are others like me.

13
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:01,920
They can't do that.

14
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:05,757
They can't take you from me.

15
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:07,893
You're my one bright light.

16
00:02:08,026 --> 00:02:10,996
I will always love you!

17
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,129
Frances!

18
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,401
Get off!

19
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:21,740
Frances!

20
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:27,313
No! No!

21
00:02:41,927 --> 00:02:44,230
Any last words?

22
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:23,469
Welcome to your new home,
Frances.

23
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,914
Your old boyfriend's
finally getting

24
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:44,983
what he deserves.

25
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:51,790
And the world will be
a safer place without him.

26
00:05:25,223 --> 00:05:27,359
Detective Mulligan,
with all due respect,

27
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,661
I don't want anything to do
with Cletus Kasady.

28
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:32,664
Well, that's too bad, because
he only wants to see you.

29
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:35,200
Though, in my opinion, you had
your chance with Kasady

30
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,835
and you blew it.

31
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:40,171
Right, um, so...
what does he want?

32
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:42,040
Maybe he wants
to spill the beans

33
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:44,209
about where the missing bodies
are buried.

34
00:05:44,342 --> 00:05:48,146
So you're gonna have to do
the right thing for a change.

35
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,586
No!

36
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,689
Take your tiny hands off of me!

37
00:05:57,823 --> 00:06:02,093
We should be out there
protecting the city lethally!

38
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:08,934
What was that?

39
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:10,235
Unhand me!

40
00:06:10,368 --> 00:06:13,271
Man should never
consent to crawl

41
00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:16,007
when he has the impulse to fly.

42
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:19,578
You are a bottom-feeder.

43
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:21,513
Be quiet.

44
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,783
How many times have I told you

45
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:29,120
that I want you to hide
yourself when I am working?

46
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:30,689
I am serious. It is important.

47
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:32,458
You have to show me respect.

48
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:34,359
Respect? Respect? Yes. Yes.

49
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:35,694
Okay. Okay.

50
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:37,563
Kasady gonna give you
the scoop, right?

51
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:39,197
Right. Wrong.

52
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,967
What do you mean?
Because you blow everything.

53
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,968
Oh, okay, I see.

54
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:44,570
You're talking about Anne again.

55
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:46,605
I miss her!

56
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:50,476
I will do it.

57
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:51,810
I don't like you.

58
00:06:51,943 --> 00:06:53,344
Let me eat him!

59
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,883
You do not deserve nice things.

60
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,930
Welcome back, Eddie Brock.

61
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:15,934
I've been thinking about you.

62
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:19,638
What do you want, Cletus?

63
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:22,273
I mean, why am I here?

64
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:28,647
Do a man who's buried alive
a kindness, won't you?

65
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,350
Get a message out to all my...

66
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:33,619
fans.

67
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:38,757
And in return,
I'll give you my life.

68
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,890
What?

69
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:41,059
Story.

70
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:43,562
I heard the written word

71
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:46,431
hasn't been working out so well.

72
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:50,602
Piece like this, an exclusive...

73
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,872
would put you back on top.

74
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:57,042
Go on.

75
00:07:57,175 --> 00:07:59,711
People love...

76
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:01,713
serial killers.

77
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:09,020
All my secrets laid bare, Eddie.

78
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:12,524
So much carnage.

79
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,759
But why me?

80
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,029
I like you.

81
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:20,031
All right, it's a deal.

82
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:22,300
What's your message?

83
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:29,174
That distant cathedral

84
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:31,743
is all I see... Mm-hmm.

85
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:36,314
Fractured angel

86
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:38,917
the other part of me.

87
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:42,921
Print that in your column.

88
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:45,857
Is that it? This, um...
Who's gonna...

89
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:49,661
Who's gonna read that,
some random haiku?

90
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:52,530
Print it,

91
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:56,201
and what's mine is yours.

92
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:58,436
Wow, lucky me.

93
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,305
Goodbye, Eddie.

94
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:02,306
Thank you.

95
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,275
Thank you.

96
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:06,544
What a dick.

97
00:09:07,445 --> 00:09:10,048
Eddie, look. Look.

98
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:11,650
What are you doing?

99
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:14,119
Your job for you.

100
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:23,094
Eddie.

101
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:28,600
Don't forget me, Eddie.

102
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,143
What did you get?

103
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:41,279
Uh, I got a headache
and probably got tuberculosis.

104
00:09:41,412 --> 00:09:42,948
What? A little louder.

105
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:45,583
He read me poetry, man.

106
00:09:45,717 --> 00:09:46,961
Is this some kind of joke
to you, Eddie?

107
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:48,419
Because I'm not laughing.

108
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:50,689
Yeah, you could do with a laugh.

109
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:52,257
Come on, man.

110
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,335
These things, they just take
a little time, all right?

111
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:56,161
Well, the second
he gives you something...

112
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:57,294
Of course.

113
00:09:57,395 --> 00:09:58,897
Keep me ahead of the curve,
Eddie.

114
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,465
Don't embarrass me. All right.

115
00:10:00,598 --> 00:10:01,700
Do you understand?

116
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,702
Trust me, the only scoop

117
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:06,104
I'm getting today
is double chocolate chip.

118
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:08,539
No! I get brain freeze.

119
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:15,080
Come here.

120
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:16,447
Look.

121
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:18,283
I'm looking. Grab those.

122
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:22,187
All right.

123
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,725
Whoa. Okay.

124
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:31,763
Now, what do you think?

125
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,733
I think I'm Pablo Picasso. No!

126
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:39,070
Okay. Come here. Look.

127
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,210
Well, say what you see.
Uh, it's a house.

128
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:46,344
Never mind.

129
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:54,986
Oh, I know this one.

130
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,055
It's a tree. Idiot.

131
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:58,924
Sit down.

132
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:02,861
Now, pay attention.

133
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,518
Bingo.

134
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:30,221
Holy cow.

135
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:38,196
Would you say your
friendship with Cletus Kasady

136
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:40,932
is what allowed you to solve
this decades-old mystery?

137
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,844
You are the only person
from the outside world

138
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,902
he's spoken with.

139
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:45,270
Seems he likes you.

140
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:47,072
Well, you know,
he's a serial killer.

141
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:48,974
I don't see how
he can like anyone.

142
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:50,809
Brock was able to uncover

143
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:53,111
what the FBI and police
could not.

144
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:56,481
Bowing to public outrage,

145
00:11:56,614 --> 00:11:59,384
the governor of California
has overturned his moratorium

146
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:01,887
and reinstated
the death penalty for Kasady.

147
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:10,829
Brock's career has been given
a much-needed revival,

148
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:13,064
putting him back on top
once more.

149
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,549
A harrowing story
finally comes to an end.

150
00:12:31,682 --> 00:12:34,820
Vindication for the victims
and closure for the families.

151
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:37,222
Thanks to the diligence
of one man.

152
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:39,757
- Thank you, Eddie Brock.
- And Venom.

153
00:12:39,891 --> 00:12:43,228
You know,
this could be us, Eddie.

154
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:47,933
Going out there, solving cases,
fighting bad guys.

155
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:49,868
Maybe I eat them, hmm?

156
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:52,070
And then we save the day.

157
00:12:52,203 --> 00:12:54,572
- But we saved the day.
- It's done.

158
00:12:56,307 --> 00:12:59,144
You said I could eat bad guys!

159
00:12:59,277 --> 00:13:01,012
This again?

160
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:03,281
I need to be free,

161
00:13:03,414 --> 00:13:07,485
feeling the wind in my hair
and the sand between my toes.

162
00:13:07,618 --> 00:13:08,753
You don't have any hair.

163
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:10,521
You are not listening to me.

164
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:12,223
Oh, I'm listening.

165
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:15,060
I cannot live like this anymore.

166
00:13:15,193 --> 00:13:17,896
I'm starving. So eat those guys.

167
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:19,664
I can't.

168
00:13:19,797 --> 00:13:21,532
Sonny and Cher are best friends.

169
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,369
Are you serious? That's
ridiculous. That's what...

170
00:13:27,672 --> 00:13:30,475
Man, that was abusive.

171
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:32,143
That was abuse.

172
00:13:33,744 --> 00:13:35,680
And that's a $2,000 TV.

173
00:13:35,813 --> 00:13:38,149
You have got to get control
of your aggression.

174
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:39,750
That is why we have Snookie!

175
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,320
I cannot live on chicken
and chocolate alone.

176
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:43,654
I need brains.

177
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:45,056
Chickens have brains.

178
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,325
I most passionately disagree.

179
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:49,760
Look.

180
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,696
Look at those poor idiots.

181
00:13:53,464 --> 00:13:54,699
Small brains.

182
00:13:54,832 --> 00:13:56,968
Come on, man, it's not
their fault that you, uh...

183
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,970
you live on
the old phenylethyla...

184
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,447
laphenylethylan.
Phenylethylalanine.

185
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:01,839
Yeah, I just...
I just said that.

186
00:14:01,973 --> 00:14:03,308
I've told you a thousand times,

187
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:05,110
because it is only found...
Yeah?

188
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:07,412
In brains and in chocolate.
And in chocolate.

189
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:09,447
That's right. All right,
well, how about this?

190
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,051
You live in my body,
you live by my rules.

191
00:14:13,184 --> 00:14:15,086
I live in your body because...
Why?

192
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,223
Unfortunately,
I don't have many options.

193
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:20,325
Well, how about this, son?

194
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,393
The FBI is still
investigating us

195
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:25,130
for all of that stuff that
"we were involved with,"

196
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:27,432
so if one more head
goes missing,

197
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:30,868
we will get hauled off
into Area 51.

198
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:32,203
They will kill us both.

199
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:35,140
So somebody has to be
responsible.

200
00:14:35,273 --> 00:14:39,610
Responsibility...
it's for the mediocre.

201
00:14:42,747 --> 00:14:44,249
Food! Can you stop doing that?

202
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:46,952
Food! Food! Please just
stop doing that now.

203
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:48,285
Come on, stop doing that. Food!

204
00:14:48,386 --> 00:14:49,863
I have a deadline! Will you...
Food...!

205
00:14:49,887 --> 00:14:51,722
Goddamn it! Fine!

206
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:00,098
Good evening, Eddie.
Hey, Mrs. Chen.

207
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:01,832
Good evening, Venom.

208
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,268
He says hi. Oh.

209
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:04,802
Chocolate hasn't arrived yet.

210
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:07,572
No! Oh, no. We have a deal.

211
00:15:07,705 --> 00:15:10,408
What's gonna happen?
You gonna stop protecting me?

212
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,909
I don't think so.

213
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:13,444
I've been keeping my mouth shut,

214
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:15,580
feeding your little secret. Wow.

215
00:15:15,713 --> 00:15:18,716
Little old Mrs. Chen is
a little old blackmailer, huh?

216
00:15:18,849 --> 00:15:21,219
Less of the old. I am 39.

217
00:15:21,352 --> 00:15:23,588
And I am Barry Manilow. Right.

218
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:25,490
I am happy to eat Mrs. Chen.

219
00:15:25,623 --> 00:15:28,293
No, no, you cannot eat
Mrs. Chen.

220
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:32,497
What? Well, I guess it's
gonna have to be plan B.

221
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:36,234
What's plan B?

222
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,669
Aah! Not this again!

223
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:41,572
I need human brains to survive.

224
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:44,009
Uh-uh. Now, pick up
some chickens, man.

225
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:45,643
Let's go.

226
00:15:59,324 --> 00:16:02,227
I'm done with this grossness.

227
00:16:06,297 --> 00:16:09,467
Look at all the amazing things
that we can do.

228
00:16:11,902 --> 00:16:15,240
We are wasting our talent.

229
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:25,283
Bad guy.

230
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:31,656
Hello, kitty.

231
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:35,160
Leave him. Leave him be.

232
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:37,595
Leave him be! Leave him be!

233
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:40,765
- I shall remove your head.
- No, you won't.

234
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:43,168
I will use it for bowling!
No, you will not.

235
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:45,036
I will take it to...

236
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,837
What is the one
that we like, Eddie?

237
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:48,273
It's Lucky Strike.

238
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:50,408
- Yes! Lucky Strike!
- Put him down!

239
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,277
I will take you to Lucky Strike,

240
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,679
and I will score
a 300-point game.

241
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:56,614
You won't.
The rest of your pudgy little

242
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:59,284
boy body will be left here...

243
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,719
rolling around
in dumpster juice.

244
00:17:01,852 --> 00:17:03,588
Oh, God.

245
00:17:03,721 --> 00:17:06,524
No! Put him down!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

246
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:08,626
no, no, no, no, no, no!

247
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,561
No!

248
00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:12,330
Fine!

249
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:15,766
She didn't want our help.

250
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,969
She did not know
she needed our help, Eddie.

251
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,671
There is a difference.

252
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,777
It is Anne.

253
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:30,481
Anne is on the phone, Eddie!

254
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,219
Hey, Anne.

255
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:35,720
Hey, E-Eddie. Hi.

256
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:37,222
- Hi.
- Be nice to her.

257
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:38,623
You sound out of breath.

258
00:17:38,756 --> 00:17:41,292
I'm-I'm not catching you
at a bad time, am I?

259
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:43,894
No, no, not at all.
I'm just, uh...

260
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:46,097
I'm just hanging around. Okay.

261
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,066
Uh, I'm-I'm sorry
I haven't returned your calls.

262
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,701
I guess...

263
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:53,738
I just needed a little space
after the whole...

264
00:17:53,871 --> 00:17:56,307
alien biting a guy's
head off thing, so...

265
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:58,042
Ah, the good old days.

266
00:17:58,176 --> 00:18:00,044
Anyway, so I have some news,

267
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:01,846
and-and I was wondering
if we could meet.

268
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:04,315
Yes!
Yeah, sure, that would be, uh...

269
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:06,651
That would be fine. Great.

270
00:18:06,784 --> 00:18:08,986
Okay, great.
Uh, how's tomorrow night?

271
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,222
Tomorrow night? Yeah, great.

272
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,358
8:00? L'Araignée?

273
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:14,801
Okay, great.
Looking forward to it.

274
00:18:14,825 --> 00:18:16,394
Oh... Yeah, okay. Me, too. Bye.

275
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:17,528
Great.

276
00:18:17,662 --> 00:18:18,729
It's over with the doctor!

277
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:20,064
That is the voice of a woman

278
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:22,267
who just got brutally dumped.

279
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,502
♪ All right ♪

280
00:18:26,937 --> 00:18:28,873
♪ Yeah... ♪

281
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,808
Stop.

282
00:18:30,941 --> 00:18:32,843
Don't you want
to look your best?

283
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:36,046
Just leave me alone.
You are always nitpicking.

284
00:18:41,852 --> 00:18:42,987
Wow.

285
00:18:44,822 --> 00:18:46,357
Hey.

286
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:48,626
Okay. Hi. Yeah.

287
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,729
Wow.

288
00:18:55,065 --> 00:18:56,434
Awkward.

289
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:58,436
So, uh, h-how's it going?
How's, uh...

290
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:00,571
How's Mr. Belvedere? Yeah.
Uh, good, good.

291
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:02,649
You know, he's still wiping
his ass on the carpet.

292
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:04,342
He learned that from you.

293
00:19:04,475 --> 00:19:06,911
Yeah, how-how's, uh...
how's the legal aid work going?

294
00:19:07,044 --> 00:19:09,180
Well, you know how much
I love an underdog, so...

295
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,148
Yeah. Yeah, that's why you...

296
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:13,150
put up with me for so long, huh?

297
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:14,452
You said it.

298
00:19:15,886 --> 00:19:17,855
S-So... So...

299
00:19:17,988 --> 00:19:19,824
So?

300
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:22,159
I don't know, I-I thought
it would be better

301
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:24,161
to tell you in person that...

302
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:26,431
Uh-huh.

303
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:29,934
No!

304
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:31,402
Wow. Oh, Anne.

305
00:19:31,536 --> 00:19:32,737
Wow, that is, uh...

306
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,273
that is so much bigger
than the...

307
00:19:35,406 --> 00:19:36,907
the one that I got you.

308
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,343
Ugh, it's gaudy.

309
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:40,345
That's Dan, right?
Doc-Doctor Dan.

310
00:19:40,478 --> 00:19:41,946
Yeah, that... it's Dan.

311
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,881
Holy shit, Anne. Way to go.

312
00:19:44,014 --> 00:19:45,014
Are you okay?

313
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:46,251
Yeah, I'm okay.

314
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:48,519
Well, I am not okay. Yeah.

315
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:50,093
You could just say,
"Congratulations.

316
00:19:50,187 --> 00:19:51,489
I'm happy for you."

317
00:19:51,622 --> 00:19:52,990
You know, like two people

318
00:19:53,123 --> 00:19:54,925
who still care enough
about each other to lie

319
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:56,970
so that the other one doesn't
feel like complete shit. I...

320
00:19:56,994 --> 00:19:58,596
Maybe we could do
that version of this?

321
00:19:58,729 --> 00:20:01,065
No, I am...
I am happy for you, Anne.

322
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:02,700
- You know, I'm, uh...
- No.

323
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:03,968
Congratulations.

324
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:05,336
Thank you.

325
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,938
That was going to be us, Eddie.

326
00:20:08,072 --> 00:20:10,441
I, for one, would not
be inconsolable

327
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:12,209
if Dan were to fall into traffic

328
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:14,011
and lose his head and his feet

329
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:16,080
and all of his teeth! What?

330
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:17,214
What was that?

331
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:19,850
What? Nothing.

332
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:21,319
Whoa.

333
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:23,388
If I ask you a question,

334
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:25,890
do you have the ability
to tell me the truth?

335
00:20:26,023 --> 00:20:27,425
You mean as in being

336
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:29,494
super happy for you
because of your engagement?

337
00:20:29,627 --> 00:20:31,228
Because, I mean,
you just told me to lie,

338
00:20:31,362 --> 00:20:33,230
so that's really,
really confusing.

339
00:20:33,364 --> 00:20:34,699
Is Venom with you?

340
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:36,767
He's dead.

341
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,769
- I am.
- I'm playing dead right now.

342
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:40,271
Yeah, I mean, he...

343
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:42,940
Right.

344
00:20:43,073 --> 00:20:44,342
Okay. Okay.

345
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:47,345
Well, that's...

346
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,780
You just don't change, do you?

347
00:20:49,914 --> 00:20:51,525
What are you talking about?
This is just a...

348
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:53,484
It's a huge shock. Um, I'm in...

349
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:55,986
Anne, I'm in love with you.
This is a lot to process.

350
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,255
No, the truth is you don't
love anybody. You can't.

351
00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:00,291
Commitment's just not
your thing.

352
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,960
All right, then, fine.

353
00:21:03,093 --> 00:21:05,129
Do not marry Dan.

354
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:07,698
Dan makes me feel safe. Ugh.

355
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:10,601
Okay, and you made me feel
like I was on a roller coaster.

356
00:21:10,735 --> 00:21:13,270
And sometimes you just
have to know when to get off.

357
00:21:13,404 --> 00:21:14,972
- Yeah, and not yak.
- And not yak!

358
00:21:15,105 --> 00:21:16,607
You know, not yak.

359
00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:18,376
Yak.

360
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:23,180
Hey, Venom.

361
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:26,283
Take care of him, all right?

362
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:28,185
Don't let him keep
messing everything up.

363
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,322
I'm going
to make you cry now, Eddie.

364
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,123
She will love it.

365
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:36,126
Cry. Cry.

366
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,028
It's a lot to process.

367
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:41,432
Congratulations, Anne.

368
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,701
It's great news.

369
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:56,146
Slow down, pal.

370
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,415
Why?

371
00:21:57,548 --> 00:21:59,584
You don't believe
in consequences.

372
00:21:59,717 --> 00:22:02,186
No injuries. You fix them.

373
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,321
No hangovers. You mend them.

374
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:06,491
I couldn't even hurt myself
if I tried.

375
00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:18,969
Eddie, I apologize
that I can't mend the heart.

376
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:22,440
Emotional pain,
it hits much harder,

377
00:22:22,573 --> 00:22:24,742
and it lasts longer.

378
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:30,080
You just need to pull up
your big-boy pants and take it.

379
00:22:30,214 --> 00:22:32,717
Yeah, well, that's easy
for you to say.

380
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,919
Why?

381
00:22:35,052 --> 00:22:37,287
Because I'm a real boy

382
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,957
and you're just an amoeba.

383
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,792
I will only take that

384
00:22:41,926 --> 00:22:44,495
because we are hurting
right now.

385
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:52,503
Don't worry, buddy.
I will get you through this.

386
00:22:59,744 --> 00:23:01,946
Do you know what always
cheers me up

387
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:03,881
in the morning, Eddie?

388
00:23:04,014 --> 00:23:06,717

Whoa, listen to this.

407
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:58,235
"Dearest pally pal,

408
00:23:58,368 --> 00:24:01,872
"I hereby invite you to witness

409
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:05,142

"on this spinning shit wheel

that we call Earth."

413
00:24:15,886 --> 00:24:18,288
You are responsible

414
00:24:18,422 --> 00:24:22,326
for bringing about the end
of Cletus Kasady.

415
00:24:22,459 --> 00:24:27,464
It's only right that you hold
the door for me on my way out.

416
00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:29,900
They'll stop my heart...

417
00:24:30,034 --> 00:24:31,969
just like it stopped
at my birth.

418
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:34,872
What if Cletus Kasady

419
00:24:35,005 --> 00:24:37,141
had never been revived?

420
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:39,677
He would never
have pushed Grandma

421
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,847
down a flight of stairs.

422
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:47,284
Bye-bye, Grandma,
you puckered old sphincter.

423
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:50,087
He would never have thrown
a hair dryer

424
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,822
into Mother's bathtub.

425
00:24:53,924 --> 00:24:56,694
Yes, Mama, I'm a bad, bad boy.

426
00:24:56,827 --> 00:24:58,929
He would never have been beaten

427
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:01,666
to the brink of death by Daddy-o

428
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,434
and sent to...

429
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:08,372
St. Estes Home
for Unwanted Children.

430
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:16,714
That circus of hell...

431
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:25,522
with one bright light.

432
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:30,027
Oh, Eddie,

433
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,399
we are all born into this world
through blood and pain.

434
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:39,169
Every hero has an origin story.

435
00:25:43,674 --> 00:25:45,209
Your friend...

436
00:25:45,342 --> 00:25:47,211
"Cletus Kasady."

437
00:25:47,344 --> 00:25:50,247
Kiss, hug, kiss, hug.

438
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:53,250
Smiley face.

439
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:55,686
Ew.

440
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,987
Nutjob.

441
00:25:57,121 --> 00:25:58,723
You know, I-I should be there.

442
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:00,357
Uh, no, it's a bad idea.

443
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,859
I mean, I-I-I put him there.

444
00:26:01,992 --> 00:26:03,427
Actually, he put himself there

445
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,130
when he decided to be
a complete lunatic.

446
00:26:06,263 --> 00:26:07,531
Ta-da!

447
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:10,034
You know, it would be nice
just to have your support

448
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:12,069
just... I mean, just for once.

449
00:26:12,202 --> 00:26:15,005
Catsup? You know what I mean?

450
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:17,341
This place is
an all-you-can-eat buffet.

451
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:18,843
Who's going to care

452
00:26:18,976 --> 00:26:20,645
if I polish off
a couple of these idiots?

453
00:26:20,778 --> 00:26:22,898
You can't be sure who is
and who is not guilty, buddy.

454
00:26:23,013 --> 00:26:24,693
- They're in prison!
- Yeah, but, you know,

455
00:26:24,782 --> 00:26:26,142
some people take
false confessions.

456
00:26:26,216 --> 00:26:27,696
They, uh... you know,
they take pleas.

457
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,053
We watched Making a Murderer.

458
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:30,020
You all right?

459
00:26:30,154 --> 00:26:31,722
Yeah, man, I'm just practicing.

460
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,590
I am a predator, Eddie.

461
00:26:33,724 --> 00:26:35,793
Mm-hmm. Lions do not eat salad.

462
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:37,366
Yeah, but you're not a lion,
are you?

463
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:39,429
I mean, I see you
more of a vexatious little

464
00:26:39,563 --> 00:26:41,498
pig, dog, house bat thing.

465
00:26:41,632 --> 00:26:42,667
That's fine.

466
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,601
You suck. You suck!

467
00:26:44,735 --> 00:26:46,470
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, wow.

468
00:26:46,603 --> 00:26:48,138
I don't have
an explanation for that.

469
00:26:48,272 --> 00:26:51,508
I think I just... I'm having
a panic attack, um...

470
00:26:51,642 --> 00:26:53,277
Yeah, I'll sign here.

471
00:26:54,578 --> 00:26:56,280
Stand two feet away
from the bars.

472
00:26:56,413 --> 00:26:58,348
No touching the condemned.

473
00:26:58,482 --> 00:27:00,384
Understood.

474
00:27:00,517 --> 00:27:03,520
Visitor's here.

475
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:12,830
This is a "me" thing,
not a "we" thing.

476
00:27:12,963 --> 00:27:14,765
Everything is a "you" thing.

477
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:18,435
Oh, happy day
for you, Eddie Brock.

478
00:27:18,568 --> 00:27:21,338
Mm, what a scoop.

479
00:27:21,471 --> 00:27:24,041
The end of the Magical...

480
00:27:24,174 --> 00:27:25,843
Misery Tour.

481
00:27:25,976 --> 00:27:28,813
I worry for your soul.

482
00:27:28,946 --> 00:27:30,514
How will you live
with the weight

483
00:27:30,647 --> 00:27:32,382
of snuffing out a man's life?

484
00:27:32,516 --> 00:27:34,218
I was, uh... I was hoping

485
00:27:34,351 --> 00:27:36,553
maybe you could give me
a couple pointers.

486
00:27:39,857 --> 00:27:41,726
Funny little guy, aren't you?

487
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:43,527
Don't need that.

488
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,796
My memory is outstanding.

489
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:49,199
Rude.

490
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,769
Consequences.

491
00:27:51,902 --> 00:27:55,539
Every decision you ever make.

492
00:27:55,672 --> 00:27:59,009
Who do we leave behind,

493
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:00,978
and how do we leave them?

494
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:06,550
A connubial bed, empty,

495
00:28:06,683 --> 00:28:09,553
waiting in the darkness

496
00:28:09,686 --> 00:28:12,689
for the rescuer who never comes.

497
00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:13,991
Because of you.

498
00:28:14,124 --> 00:28:15,692
This guy makes zero sense.

499
00:28:15,826 --> 00:28:19,730
You and I are the same.

500
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,999
No. No, we're not.

501
00:28:22,132 --> 00:28:25,302
Twisted insides, mean daddies.

502
00:28:25,435 --> 00:28:28,405
You feel like home to me,
Eddie, like family.

503
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:30,640
And really, truly,

504
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,477
that is all I ever wanted
in this world.

505
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,912
Family.

506
00:28:35,045 --> 00:28:37,114
Well, killing your grandmother
and your mother

507
00:28:37,247 --> 00:28:39,116
sure is a funny way
of showing it.

508
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:45,990
Anything you want to unburden
yourself with before...

509
00:28:47,357 --> 00:28:50,895
um, this happens?

510
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,030
Yes.

511
00:28:53,163 --> 00:28:57,968
I have wishes
to bestow upon you.

512
00:28:58,102 --> 00:28:59,569
Oh, that is kind.

513
00:28:59,703 --> 00:29:03,573
I want to wish you...

514
00:29:03,707 --> 00:29:05,575
this heartbreak.

515
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:07,311
Uh-oh. Too late.

516
00:29:07,444 --> 00:29:11,348
I wish for you
to see out your days alone,

517
00:29:11,481 --> 00:29:13,350
as you always have been.

518
00:29:13,483 --> 00:29:14,651
Watch it, pal.

519
00:29:14,785 --> 00:29:16,353
Wh-Where are you going
with this?

520
00:29:16,486 --> 00:29:18,455
You are a cancer

521
00:29:18,588 --> 00:29:22,192
to everyone
who ever loved you, Eddie.

522
00:29:22,326 --> 00:29:25,863
Deceived your trusting fiancée.

523
00:29:25,996 --> 00:29:30,167
And no wonder Daddy
could never look at you again

524
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,037
after you killed his wife,
your mother,

525
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,972
just by being born.

526
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:36,907
You son of a bitch!

527
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,742
No, no! No, no, no, don't!
Don't!

528
00:29:38,876 --> 00:29:41,345
Speak to my friend again
like that... I dare you!

529
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:45,883
Hey, hey!

530
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,617
No touching the inmate.

531
00:29:47,751 --> 00:29:49,219
Hey, back up!

532
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,959
Eddie?

533
00:29:55,092 --> 00:29:56,660
You're done.

534
00:29:56,793 --> 00:30:02,132
I have tasted blood before,
my friend, and that is not it.

535
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:05,936
Eddie Brock has a big secret.

536
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,905
Shut up, Kasady!

537
00:30:17,447 --> 00:30:19,416
That may have been a mistake.

538
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:21,451
Shut up.

539
00:30:21,585 --> 00:30:23,520
Hey, aren't you Eddie Brock?

540
00:30:23,653 --> 00:30:25,589
I don't know anymore.

541
00:30:27,657 --> 00:30:29,293
Eddie!

542
00:30:29,426 --> 00:30:31,171
I don't want to hear
another word out your mouth.

543
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:32,829
Eddie. I don't want to hear it.

544
00:30:32,963 --> 00:30:34,631
Eddie, I am sorry.

545
00:30:34,764 --> 00:30:37,267
That was his last time
on record ever.

546
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:39,870
There's no more...
any words for his victims or...

547
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,405
You know, they're gone.

548
00:30:41,538 --> 00:30:43,941
Any clues of outstanding bodies,

549
00:30:44,074 --> 00:30:45,775
we-we've lost forever
and completely.

550
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,211
I didn't mean to.

551
00:30:47,344 --> 00:30:48,944
You didn't mean to?
And I said I'm sorry.

552
00:30:49,046 --> 00:30:50,406
You didn't mean to,
but you did it.

553
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,025
I mean, you just decided...
I don't know.

554
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:53,183
That's it, you did it.

555
00:30:53,317 --> 00:30:54,684
You know, you didn't even think

556
00:30:54,818 --> 00:30:56,596
that we might get caught,
we might get killed?

557
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,364
No, you don't think about
things like that, do you?

558
00:30:58,388 --> 00:31:00,133
You just think about chickens,
you think about you,

559
00:31:00,157 --> 00:31:02,326
you think about what you want,
and you think about you.

560
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:04,228
Let me remind you
of something, Eddie.

561
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:06,096
You were a loser
before I came along.

562
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,165
You were nothing.
I made you special.

563
00:31:08,298 --> 00:31:09,566
Oh, you made me special, huh?

564
00:31:09,699 --> 00:31:11,211
Well, let me tell you
something, right?

565
00:31:11,235 --> 00:31:12,636
Before you came along,
I had a life.

566
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:14,347
I didn't have chickens,
all right? But I had dreams.

567
00:31:14,371 --> 00:31:15,715
Yeah, I had dreams,
and I had a fiancée,

568
00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:17,441
and I had a really successful
TV show!

569
00:31:17,574 --> 00:31:20,510
Ah, but you destroyed all
of those things by yourself.

570
00:31:21,678 --> 00:31:23,547
Yeah, but you know what?
I rebuilt my life,

571
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,415
and now I just want to live it.
Good night.

572
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:26,951
And how did you build
this new life?

573
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:28,285
Hmm? Excuse me?

574
00:31:28,418 --> 00:31:30,254
Well, who found the clue
on the wall

575
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:32,789
so you could be
this big, shiny hero?

576
00:31:32,923 --> 00:31:34,491
Hmm? Who found the clue?

577
00:31:34,624 --> 00:31:36,326
Who? Wow.

578
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,527
Yeah.

579
00:31:37,661 --> 00:31:38,996
No, no, no.

580
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:42,499
This is not about
being a hero for me, man.

581
00:31:42,632 --> 00:31:46,203
This is about wanting
to live in peace.

582
00:31:46,336 --> 00:31:49,506
D-Do you understand
what I'm talking about?

583
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:50,975
No, you don't.

584
00:31:51,108 --> 00:31:52,452
You don't understand
what I'm talking about.

585
00:31:52,476 --> 00:31:53,978
Okay, this is about me
wanting to live

586
00:31:54,111 --> 00:31:56,313
without you whining
in my ear all the time

587
00:31:56,446 --> 00:32:00,184
about eating bad guys
or, like, nagging me about Anne

588
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:02,452
or destroying my place
or destroying my life!

589
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:06,523
Do you know how lucky you are
that I chose you?

590
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,125
You chose me?

591
00:32:08,258 --> 00:32:10,127
Buddy, I'm the only person
that took you in

592
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,238
when your friends kicked you
off the planet Ming Mong

593
00:32:12,262 --> 00:32:13,630
'cause you are a reject!

594
00:32:13,763 --> 00:32:16,200
You are a pariah.
Lethal protection, my ass.

595
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:18,202
You couldn't protect anything.
You are useless.

596
00:32:18,335 --> 00:32:20,971
You couldn't get a job
down here cleaning toilets!

597
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,007
I'm sorry.

598
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,350
I don't know what came over me.

599
00:32:24,374 --> 00:32:25,675
Please, let me fix it.

600
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:27,177
So I can break it again!

601
00:32:32,882 --> 00:32:35,719
You son of a bitch.

602
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:44,561
Out!

603
00:32:44,694 --> 00:32:45,762
Get out.

604
00:32:45,895 --> 00:32:47,197
Take your stuff. Get out!

605
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:49,699
This is my house.

606
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:51,901
No!

607
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,437
Keep it down up there!

608
00:32:56,273 --> 00:32:57,674
Get out!

609
00:33:07,184 --> 00:33:09,253
Sonny?

610
00:33:09,386 --> 00:33:11,021
You wouldn't dare!

611
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,323
Yeah, absolutely.

612
00:33:15,592 --> 00:33:17,361
No, no, no!

613
00:33:17,494 --> 00:33:19,063
Yeah! No!

614
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:20,697
I'm calling the police!

615
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,599
I-I am so sorry.

616
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,304
Show yourself.

617
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:41,618
You can't win!
Take a look at me.

618
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:43,587
Look at the size of you.

619
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,422
Puny.

620
00:33:48,358 --> 00:33:50,227
How dare you?

621
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:57,101
I guess this is goodbye.

622
00:33:57,234 --> 00:34:00,304
Oh, yeah.
Finally something we agree on.

623
00:34:05,242 --> 00:34:07,144
What in the world?

624
00:34:07,277 --> 00:34:08,912
All this crazy shit.

625
00:34:09,045 --> 00:34:10,647
Yeah.

626
00:34:21,991 --> 00:34:24,594
Hmm?

627
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,065
No. No.

628
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,335
No, no, no, no.

629
00:34:33,203 --> 00:34:34,904
No!

630
00:34:35,038 --> 00:34:37,006
Yeah!

631
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:39,008
No!

632
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,311
Yeah! No!

633
00:34:42,212 --> 00:34:44,080
Oh, yeah.

634
00:34:44,948 --> 00:34:46,015
No.

635
00:34:51,288 --> 00:34:52,756
No, no, no.

636
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:54,624
I wish I never met you!

637
00:34:55,925 --> 00:34:57,794
Sayonara!

638
00:35:09,706 --> 00:35:12,876
Cletus Kasady,
you have been tried, convicted

639
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:16,480
and sentenced to death
by the state of California.

640
00:35:17,947 --> 00:35:22,186
May your passing bring closure
to the victims' families,

641
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:26,089
and may you find peace
in the hereafter.

642
00:35:26,223 --> 00:35:28,892
Soon come chaos.

643
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:31,728
Chaos soon come.

644
00:35:32,662 --> 00:35:34,498
Are those your final words?

645
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,402
Enjoy the show.

646
00:36:16,406 --> 00:36:18,942
Warden.

647
00:36:19,075 --> 00:36:21,345
Something wicked...

648
00:36:21,478 --> 00:36:23,847
this way comes.

649
00:36:33,423 --> 00:36:36,393
Somebody let me out!

650
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:51,868
Don't move!

651
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:04,213
Hey!

652
00:38:18,828 --> 00:38:20,397
Please.

653
00:38:21,998 --> 00:38:23,733
I got a family.

654
00:38:48,024 --> 00:38:50,226
Any last words, Warden?

655
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,095
Don't! Please!

656
00:39:07,944 --> 00:39:11,948
♪ San Quentin, may you rot
And burn in hell ♪

657
00:39:12,081 --> 00:39:15,919
♪ May your walls fall down
And may I live to tell ♪

658
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,957
♪ And I'll walk out
A wiser, stronger man ♪

659
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:24,628
♪ And, Warden
You tasted just like ham ♪

660
00:39:51,187 --> 00:39:53,122
You two are being evicted.

661
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:04,534
Come on, don't look at me
like that.

662
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,335
It was never,
never gonna work out.

663
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,871
All right?

664
00:40:17,814 --> 00:40:19,382
Yes.

665
00:40:19,516 --> 00:40:21,284
Just because
of how quickly he moved in...

666
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:22,928
the offensive line
cannot pick him up.

667
00:40:22,952 --> 00:40:24,621
Breaking news.

668
00:40:24,754 --> 00:40:26,823
Serial killer Cletus Kasady
is on the run...

669
00:40:26,956 --> 00:40:28,157
Shit.

670
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:29,769
As a statewide
manhunt is underway...

671
00:40:29,793 --> 00:40:31,561
Oh, shit.
after last night's audacious

672
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:33,129
escape from San Quentin Prison.

673
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,871
It is absolutely chaos here.

674
00:40:42,005 --> 00:40:45,341
We have reports
of multiple casualties.

675
00:40:45,475 --> 00:40:47,777
We don't how Cletus Kasady...

676
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:49,345
Hey. What, you're not dead?

677
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:50,647
No.

678
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,549
Can I come in? Yeah, sure.

679
00:40:52,682 --> 00:40:54,083
Come on in.

680
00:40:54,217 --> 00:40:57,821
Uh, yeah, I was just seeing
for myself on the news.

681
00:40:57,954 --> 00:41:01,024
Yeah, on a scale
of one to ten, it's 11 bad.

682
00:41:01,157 --> 00:41:03,292
Reports coming
from San Quentin are,

683
00:41:03,426 --> 00:41:05,428
quite frankly, bananas. Nice TV.

684
00:41:05,562 --> 00:41:07,597
W-Well, how-how did he do it?

685
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,165
Yeah, how did he, indeed? Yeah.

686
00:41:09,298 --> 00:41:10,934
That's the million-dollar
question.

687
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:13,436
And yet again, you were
his special visitor.

688
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,271
So, what did he tell you?

689
00:41:15,404 --> 00:41:17,306
Me? Nothing. Nothing at all.

690
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,108
Nothing about an escape plan?

691
00:41:19,242 --> 00:41:21,911
Nothing about some kind
of elaborate breakout costume?

692
00:41:22,045 --> 00:41:23,346
No.

693
00:41:23,479 --> 00:41:24,781
Well, how come, every time,

694
00:41:24,914 --> 00:41:26,916
you seem to be at the center
of these things

695
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,485
and then miraculously
you know nothing about it?

696
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:32,188
Maybe I'm lucky.

697
00:41:32,321 --> 00:41:34,524
Yeah, right.

698
00:41:37,093 --> 00:41:38,127
You-you said, um...

699
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:40,329
the reports coming out

700
00:41:40,463 --> 00:41:42,365
of San Quentin are bananas?

701
00:41:42,498 --> 00:41:44,298
What-what do...
what do you mean by "bananas"?

702
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,945
Remember when I asked you
a similar question...

703
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:48,738
Uh-huh. ...the day
you interviewed him?

704
00:41:48,872 --> 00:41:50,807
Information is currency.

705
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,442
You of all people
should know that.

706
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,712
Come on.

707
00:41:58,347 --> 00:42:00,283
I thought he'd come
to try to find the man

708
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:04,453
that nearly got him executed,
but I guess not.

709
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:06,322
I'd lay low if I was you.

710
00:42:06,455 --> 00:42:09,158
I'll see myself out.

711
00:42:18,467 --> 00:42:19,669
Okay, think.

712
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,504
Think, think,
think, think, think.

713
00:42:21,638 --> 00:42:23,506
What would Venom do?

714
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,174
He would find you
before you find me,

715
00:42:25,308 --> 00:42:26,976
and he would eat your face!
Damn.

716
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,012
All right.

717
00:42:29,145 --> 00:42:30,880
Who do we leave behind,

718
00:42:31,014 --> 00:42:32,849
and how do we leave them?

719
00:42:32,982 --> 00:42:35,418
A connubial bed, empty...
"Connubial bed."

720
00:42:35,551 --> 00:42:38,021
left to rot...
Is it marriage? What...

721
00:42:38,154 --> 00:42:40,957
waiting in the darkness for
the rescuer who never comes.

722
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,525
I don't understand.

723
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:46,462
"That circle of hell..."

724
00:42:46,596 --> 00:42:48,698
Because of you.

725
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:52,736
You and I are the same.
"With one bright light"?

726
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:54,838
Twisted insides, mean daddies.

727
00:42:54,971 --> 00:42:56,205
"Bright light."

728
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:59,542
You feel like home to me.

729
00:42:59,676 --> 00:43:02,311
- Like family.
- St. Estes.

730
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,832
Crapola!

731
00:43:22,966 --> 00:43:25,635
Another one bites the dust.

732
00:43:39,048 --> 00:43:43,319
Look at all these weirdos.

733
00:43:43,452 --> 00:43:45,321
My kind of people.

734
00:43:46,622 --> 00:43:49,125
- Nice costume.
- Hey!

735
00:43:49,258 --> 00:43:50,894
Awesome work.

736
00:43:51,027 --> 00:43:53,329
Greatest costume ever.
Oh, my God.

737
00:43:53,462 --> 00:43:56,299
Oh. Is that Japanese?

738
00:43:56,432 --> 00:43:58,234
No, I made it myself.

739
00:43:58,367 --> 00:44:00,369
Hey. Who, me?

740
00:44:00,503 --> 00:44:02,371
Hello, gorgeous.

741
00:44:02,505 --> 00:44:04,373
Sorry, no, you're not my type.

742
00:44:04,507 --> 00:44:08,311
I am out of the Eddie closet.

743
00:44:33,502 --> 00:44:36,539
Hello, darlin'.

744
00:44:36,672 --> 00:44:38,541
Ooh, racer red.

745
00:44:38,674 --> 00:44:40,676
Got to have it.

746
00:44:45,348 --> 00:44:48,084
Let's get this party started.

747
00:44:50,486 --> 00:44:52,555
Oh, hell yes.

748
00:44:52,688 --> 00:44:54,223
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

749
00:44:54,357 --> 00:44:55,859
Hey! Stop!

750
00:44:55,992 --> 00:44:57,761
Stop that! Stop! Stop!

751
00:44:57,894 --> 00:44:59,729
Ah, shit.

752
00:45:05,802 --> 00:45:07,937
- You are real.
- I am.

753
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:11,474
And once I kill that thing
that made me,

754
00:45:11,607 --> 00:45:14,277
we will be indestructible.

755
00:45:15,278 --> 00:45:18,347
I know where to find him,
but first,

756
00:45:18,481 --> 00:45:22,551
I need you to help me find
something I lost.

757
00:45:22,685 --> 00:45:25,321

Your costume is amazing!

774
00:46:26,782 --> 00:46:27,851
Thank you, one person.

775
00:46:29,552 --> 00:46:31,520
Eddie was wrong.

776
00:46:33,089 --> 00:46:36,792
He kept me hidden
because he was ashamed.

777
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:40,629
But look at me now.

778
00:46:40,763 --> 00:46:43,632
You love me, and I'm free!

779
00:46:45,701 --> 00:46:48,271
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

780
00:46:49,372 --> 00:46:52,241
Stop this cruel treatment
of aliens.

781
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:54,677
It is wrong.

782
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:57,013
All of us should be able
to live together

783
00:46:57,146 --> 00:46:59,215
upon this ball of rock.

784
00:47:00,649 --> 00:47:02,018
Yeah!

785
00:47:02,151 --> 00:47:04,854
Free to be who we be!

786
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:08,557
I love you!

787
00:47:08,691 --> 00:47:09,893
I love you, too.

788
00:47:11,594 --> 00:47:13,762
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

789
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,531
Lethal Protector out.

790
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:27,143
Whoa, that was
a hard act to follow.

791
00:47:28,444 --> 00:47:31,680
I wish you could have
seen me tonight...

792
00:47:33,749 --> 00:47:35,418
Eddie.

793
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,198
Holy shit.

794
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,269
Mulligan.
Uh, it's Eddie Brock here.

795
00:48:26,402 --> 00:48:28,004
Look, uh, this may be
a long shot,

796
00:48:28,137 --> 00:48:29,648
but I-I think
I may have found something.

797
00:48:29,672 --> 00:48:31,207
Go on, Eddie. What do you got?

798
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,018
Last time I spoke to Kasady,
he was talking to me

799
00:48:33,042 --> 00:48:35,111
about connubial beds
and-and marriage.

800
00:48:35,244 --> 00:48:36,821
And, uh, it didn't make
a whole lot of sense to me,

801
00:48:36,845 --> 00:48:39,515
but, um, I'm here at St. Estes,
and I found this, uh...

802
00:48:39,648 --> 00:48:42,351
Well, I'm standing
in front of a... of a...

803
00:48:42,485 --> 00:48:44,120
of a tree,
and I'm-I'm looking at it.

804
00:48:44,253 --> 00:48:45,693
It's, uh...
it's got a carving on it.

805
00:48:45,821 --> 00:48:50,226
It says "CK loves FB."

806
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:52,395
I'm thinking that maybe
whoever this FB is

807
00:48:52,528 --> 00:48:54,030
might know where he's headed.

808
00:48:54,163 --> 00:48:57,500
And, uh... a-and if you can,
I don't know,

809
00:48:57,633 --> 00:48:59,268
pull up some files
from St. Estes,

810
00:48:59,402 --> 00:49:03,139
maybe you can figure out
who this FB is.

811
00:49:03,272 --> 00:49:05,874
FB, that's, uh...
that's Frances Barrison.

812
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:08,644
Wow. That-that's quick.

813
00:49:08,777 --> 00:49:10,579
Yeah, it's impossible, Eddie.

814
00:49:10,713 --> 00:49:14,183
She's dead. I, uh... I shot her.

815
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:50,019
♪ A living legend
Intention his name ♪

816
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,920
♪ Don't get distracted... ♪

817
00:49:53,989 --> 00:49:55,591
Can I help you, sir?

818
00:50:12,007 --> 00:50:14,210
Got any of those internets?

819
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,162
You're alive.

820
00:50:42,505 --> 00:50:45,708
When I get out, I'm gonna
slice your face off

821
00:50:45,841 --> 00:50:47,310
and wear it to a party!

822
00:50:47,443 --> 00:50:49,512
You're never getting out
of here, Siegfried.

823
00:50:49,645 --> 00:50:51,580
No one does.

824
00:50:55,751 --> 00:50:58,554
Well, Frances,

825
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:01,023
it seems your sweetheart
has done a Houdini act

826
00:51:01,157 --> 00:51:03,259
over there at San Quentin.

827
00:51:04,893 --> 00:51:06,895
It's all over the news.

828
00:51:07,029 --> 00:51:09,598
Oh, don't get excited.

829
00:51:09,732 --> 00:51:11,600
He's not gonna find you.

830
00:51:15,504 --> 00:51:17,005
Screw you.

831
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,142
How flattering.

832
00:51:19,275 --> 00:51:20,776
But you're not my type.

833
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:22,845
I wonder where he could be.

834
00:51:26,081 --> 00:51:28,551
I'm right here.

835
00:51:28,684 --> 00:51:30,519
Ta-da.

836
00:51:52,007 --> 00:51:53,142
Hi, baby.

837
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,147
I...

838
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,150
don't want you
to freak out, okay?

839
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:04,587
Um, I'd like you to meet...

840
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,855
Carnage.

841
00:52:20,102 --> 00:52:22,070
That is so hot.

842
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,789
Go!

843
00:52:52,301 --> 00:52:53,902
A '66.

844
00:52:54,036 --> 00:52:56,138
My dream car.

845
00:52:56,272 --> 00:52:57,840
Yeah, I remember.

846
00:52:57,973 --> 00:52:59,342
Let's see what you got.

847
00:53:30,138 --> 00:53:32,575
Mm, mm.

848
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,949
Yes, baby!

849
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:00,536
This is SFPD. Stand down.

850
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:27,162
Stop!

851
00:54:27,296 --> 00:54:28,731
You'll kill him!

852
00:54:28,864 --> 00:54:32,435
She does that again,
I'll eat her face.

853
00:54:34,169 --> 00:54:36,271
He's sensitive to sound.

854
00:54:38,974 --> 00:54:42,345
Stop the vehicle. Stand down.

855
00:54:48,951 --> 00:54:52,455
Who said romance was dead?

856
00:54:57,025 --> 00:54:59,495
Hey. No drunks in here.

857
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:04,800
Help me. Food.

858
00:55:04,933 --> 00:55:06,702
Out. You get out!

859
00:55:06,835 --> 00:55:08,704
Chocolate.

860
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,541
Venom?

861
00:55:12,675 --> 00:55:14,309
I'm having trouble

862
00:55:14,443 --> 00:55:17,079
keeping them standing, Mrs. C.

863
00:55:17,212 --> 00:55:19,081
Where's Eddie?

864
00:55:19,214 --> 00:55:21,884
Food.

865
00:55:30,426 --> 00:55:32,428
Monsters!

866
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:35,163
Monsters everywhere!

867
00:55:35,297 --> 00:55:37,265
They're everywhere!

868
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,902
Monsters!

869
00:55:57,085 --> 00:55:58,887
Put out an APB.

870
00:55:59,021 --> 00:56:00,523
Form a perimeter.

871
00:56:00,656 --> 00:56:02,458
Blockade state lines.

872
00:56:02,591 --> 00:56:04,660
And bring in Brock.

873
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,364
I'm no use to anybody here.

874
00:56:09,498 --> 00:56:10,699
I'm just wasting your time.

875
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:12,468
Well, you know
what I keep thinking?

876
00:56:12,601 --> 00:56:14,241
I keep thinking,
"What else is Eddie Brock

877
00:56:14,336 --> 00:56:15,616
"not sharing
about Cletus Kasady?

878
00:56:15,738 --> 00:56:18,106
"Now, why was it Eddie
that Cletus wanted

879
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,609
"to witness the execution?" Huh?

880
00:56:20,743 --> 00:56:22,778
Bad things happen around you.

881
00:56:22,911 --> 00:56:25,080
Multiple dead bodies
at your building last year,

882
00:56:25,213 --> 00:56:28,350
that bizarre outburst
at the lobster restaurant,

883
00:56:28,484 --> 00:56:31,053
and only you
at the Life Foundation

884
00:56:31,186 --> 00:56:33,221
when that rocket exploded.

885
00:56:33,355 --> 00:56:35,057
And now Clyde's found Bonnie,

886
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:36,950
and there's a dead psychiatrist
at a facility

887
00:56:36,992 --> 00:56:38,627
I knew nothing about
until today.

888
00:56:38,761 --> 00:56:40,796
And people are talking
about seeing monsters.

889
00:56:40,929 --> 00:56:43,766
Monsters?
Uh, what-what do you mean...

890
00:56:43,899 --> 00:56:45,768
what do you mean, "monsters"?
Monsters, Eddie!

891
00:56:45,901 --> 00:56:48,504
Everywhere Cletus goes,
so goes this supposed monster.

892
00:56:48,637 --> 00:56:51,273
Oh, God. Talk to me, Eddie.

893
00:56:51,406 --> 00:56:53,141
Talk to me!

894
00:56:55,778 --> 00:56:57,112
How's he doing it, Eddie?

895
00:56:58,213 --> 00:56:59,848
What's the secret?

896
00:56:59,982 --> 00:57:02,150
How's he making people
see things?

897
00:57:02,284 --> 00:57:03,452
All right, I, uh...

898
00:57:04,953 --> 00:57:06,755
I can't answer any more
of your questions

899
00:57:06,889 --> 00:57:08,924
without making my phone call.

900
00:57:13,662 --> 00:57:15,631
I'll get you your phone call.

901
00:57:15,764 --> 00:57:18,033
But you know
what secrets want, Eddie?

902
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:19,602
They want out.

903
00:57:19,735 --> 00:57:21,704
That's why they're
so hard to keep.

904
00:57:30,546 --> 00:57:32,548
Eddie asked you to do this?

905
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:34,125
And he doesn't have anyone else
that can help him?

906
00:57:34,149 --> 00:57:35,460
We're gonna be late
for the party.

907
00:57:35,484 --> 00:57:36,619
He's in trouble, Dan.

908
00:57:36,752 --> 00:57:38,621
Yeah, trouble is his thing.

909
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:41,490
Are there gonna be aliens again?

910
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,826
No, of course not.

911
00:57:45,093 --> 00:57:46,962
I'd like to speak to him alone.

912
00:57:47,095 --> 00:57:48,964
Well, your duty of honesty
supersedes

913
00:57:49,097 --> 00:57:52,067
your duty to the client
if somebody gets harmed.

914
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,770
They teach you that
at posh school?

915
00:57:56,038 --> 00:57:57,372
Oh, hey. Anne.

916
00:57:57,506 --> 00:57:59,942
Hey, Anne, thank you so...
thank you so much for coming.

917
00:58:00,075 --> 00:58:03,078
Boy, that little guy's
a charmer, huh?

918
00:58:03,211 --> 00:58:05,581
How much do I need to worry
about you right now?

919
00:58:05,714 --> 00:58:07,115
Uh, I-I messed up.

920
00:58:07,249 --> 00:58:08,617
Okay. How badly?

921
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:11,186
Uh, it couldn't be worse,
and it's-it's all on me.

922
00:58:11,319 --> 00:58:12,555
Whatever you did, Eddie,

923
00:58:12,688 --> 00:58:14,389
you just need to tell
the cops the truth.

924
00:58:14,523 --> 00:58:16,158
No. No. No, I can't tell them

925
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:18,160
that they are chasing
a serial killer

926
00:58:18,293 --> 00:58:21,697
who's also got
an alien inside of him.

927
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:24,567
And he's capable
of killing everybody.

928
00:58:27,202 --> 00:58:28,370
Venom.

929
00:58:28,503 --> 00:58:30,539
Talk to me. What's happening?

930
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,642
No, he's-he's not here.
He's not here.

931
00:58:35,343 --> 00:58:37,613
Is this, like, an "I'm lying"
"He's not here,"

932
00:58:37,746 --> 00:58:39,414
or is this a real
"He's not here"?

933
00:58:39,548 --> 00:58:40,716
He's not here.

934
00:58:40,849 --> 00:58:42,350
Jesus Christ, Eddie.

935
00:58:42,484 --> 00:58:44,352
St. Estes fire. All units.

936
00:58:44,486 --> 00:58:45,821
What the actual f...

937
00:58:45,954 --> 00:58:47,732
Eddie, think. Think.
I don't know. I don't know.

938
00:58:47,756 --> 00:58:49,367
All I know that...
i-is that he can't go long

939
00:58:49,391 --> 00:58:51,102
without eating food, right,
so he's eating chicken

940
00:58:51,126 --> 00:58:52,761
and he eats chocolate,
and that's it.

941
00:58:52,895 --> 00:58:55,964
And that is only if he's still
observing the rules.

942
00:58:59,401 --> 00:59:00,636
We need to find him.

943
00:59:00,769 --> 00:59:02,838
You mean I need to find him.

944
00:59:02,971 --> 00:59:04,607
Yeah, you need
to find him, please.

945
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,441
And then I-I... I will fix it.

946
00:59:06,575 --> 00:59:08,777
I'll try. Thank you.

947
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:12,915
Mrs. Chen.

948
00:59:13,048 --> 00:59:14,950
Who's asking? It's me.

949
00:59:16,218 --> 00:59:17,886
What do you want?

950
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,788
Oh, she's a charmer.
Okay, listen.

951
00:59:19,922 --> 00:59:20,923
You broke Eddie's heart.

952
00:59:21,056 --> 00:59:22,296
Okay, I actually don't have time

953
00:59:22,424 --> 00:59:23,668
to explain why
that's wildly off the mark.

954
00:59:23,692 --> 00:59:24,772
Do you know where Venom is?

955
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,361
You want to break
his heart, too?

956
00:59:26,494 --> 00:59:28,263
I'm not gonna get into
who did what to who.

957
00:59:28,396 --> 00:59:30,141
Eddie said that he might be
here because of the chocolate.

958
00:59:30,165 --> 00:59:31,800
I-I just need to speak
with the alien.

959
00:59:31,934 --> 00:59:33,511
Wha... Hey, you said there
weren't gonna be any aliens.

960
00:59:33,535 --> 00:59:35,704
- I meant more aliens.
- Breaking news.

961
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:37,078
The mayor has issued a curfew...

962
00:59:37,139 --> 00:59:39,107
Can you turn
the volume up, please?

963
00:59:39,241 --> 00:59:41,009
Kasady and Barrison
should be treated

964
00:59:41,143 --> 00:59:43,679
as armed
and extremely dangerous.

965
00:59:43,812 --> 00:59:46,248
An all-out manhunt
continues tonight.

966
00:59:46,381 --> 00:59:47,650
So?

967
00:59:47,783 --> 00:59:50,018
- Cletus has a symbiote.
- Oh, my God.

968
00:59:50,152 --> 00:59:52,420
Any other information you're
pathologically lying about?

969
00:59:52,554 --> 00:59:54,289
Pussy. Excuse me?

970
00:59:54,422 --> 00:59:55,422
Eddie needs Venom.

971
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:56,570
She just called me a pussy.

972
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:57,826
He said he didn't need him,

973
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,461
that life was better
without him.

974
00:59:59,594 --> 01:00:02,865
Okay, I don't understand.
What do you care...

975
01:00:02,998 --> 01:00:05,133
Oh, wait a second.

976
01:00:07,002 --> 01:00:09,071
You get out here right now.

977
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:13,108
Do you... D-Do you see that?

978
01:00:13,241 --> 01:00:15,878
Seriously, do you see that?
Yeah, hon, I've seen it.

979
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:17,980
Eddie's going to
have to fight this battle

980
01:00:18,113 --> 01:00:20,115
all by his little bitch self.

981
01:00:20,248 --> 01:00:22,008
Oh, don't be a big baby.
Go help your friend.

982
01:00:22,117 --> 01:00:24,920
He said I couldn't
get a job fixing toilets.

983
01:00:25,821 --> 01:00:26,889
Cletus will come for him.

984
01:00:27,022 --> 01:00:28,456
He won't survive without you.

985
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:30,158
Of course he won't.

986
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:33,628
Because I am the hero
of the two of us.

987
01:00:35,831 --> 01:00:38,033
Yeah, you're the big sexy hero.

988
01:00:40,302 --> 01:00:41,770
You're the coolest,

989
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:44,372
you're the hottest,
and you're the bravest.

990
01:00:44,506 --> 01:00:45,741
I am.

991
01:00:45,874 --> 01:00:47,434
You know, I'm still
standing right here.

992
01:00:47,542 --> 01:00:49,845
No one likes you, Dan!

993
01:00:49,978 --> 01:00:52,080
I love seeing you in action.

994
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:59,621
Let's go save that asshole.

995
01:01:05,193 --> 01:01:08,396
I promised
we'd be free from here.

996
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:12,534
And we'd walk
to the cathedral on the hill.

997
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:16,404
A wedding.

998
01:01:16,538 --> 01:01:18,206
Three guests.

999
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,308
One for each of us.

1000
01:01:20,442 --> 01:01:23,311
The cop that took my eye.

1001
01:01:23,445 --> 01:01:25,547
Eddie Brock.

1002
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,250
And Venom.

1003
01:01:29,551 --> 01:01:32,454
A red wedding.

1004
01:01:35,523 --> 01:01:38,460
You... you didn't find him?

1005
01:01:49,938 --> 01:01:52,140
Oh, my Lord.

1006
01:01:52,274 --> 01:01:53,776
What happened?

1007
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:05,620
Hey, Dan.

1008
01:02:05,754 --> 01:02:07,089
All right, let's go.

1009
01:02:07,222 --> 01:02:09,091
I'm not talking to him!

1010
01:02:09,224 --> 01:02:11,126
Well, he doesn't want
to come out.

1011
01:02:11,259 --> 01:02:13,004
What-what do you mean?
We-we have to leave right now

1012
01:02:13,028 --> 01:02:14,572
'cause Cletus is gonna
wipe the city out.

1013
01:02:14,596 --> 01:02:16,664
We're not doing shit
until he apologizes.

1014
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:19,310
So, he's looking for an apology.
Look, I know that amends aren't

1015
01:02:19,334 --> 01:02:20,934
- really your thing, but...
- An apology?

1016
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:22,680
What, like, as in right...
right now, an apology?

1017
01:02:22,704 --> 01:02:25,908
I need him to beg.

1018
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:28,010
Fine, I will be
the bigger of us.

1019
01:02:28,143 --> 01:02:31,646
I will always be
the bigger of us, but go on.

1020
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:33,057
What did he say?
What is he saying?

1021
01:02:33,081 --> 01:02:34,783
He said he's listening
very sincerely.

1022
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,251
All right, listen to this.

1023
01:02:36,384 --> 01:02:37,452
I am sorry.

1024
01:02:37,585 --> 01:02:39,387
Not the right tone.

1025
01:02:39,521 --> 01:02:40,856
I'm sorry.

1026
01:02:40,989 --> 01:02:42,224
Nope.

1027
01:02:42,357 --> 01:02:43,892
I-I am sorry.

1028
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:45,527
So weird.

1029
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:46,829
I'm sorry!

1030
01:02:46,962 --> 01:02:48,172
I don't know why
you're shouting at me.

1031
01:02:48,196 --> 01:02:49,476
Well, 'cause...
Okay, well, fine.

1032
01:02:49,564 --> 01:02:51,834
I was a... I was a loser
before I met you.

1033
01:02:51,967 --> 01:02:53,601
Yep. That's right. And, uh...

1034
01:02:53,735 --> 01:02:55,503
and now I am someone.

1035
01:02:57,405 --> 01:02:59,875
All right? You made me special.

1036
01:03:00,008 --> 01:03:01,109
Damn right.

1037
01:03:01,243 --> 01:03:02,523
Why don't you put
a cherry on it?

1038
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:05,480
A cherry on that? Right. Um...

1039
01:03:05,613 --> 01:03:07,282
I'm...

1040
01:03:07,415 --> 01:03:10,218
I-I am truly very sorry
for everything that I said.

1041
01:03:10,352 --> 01:03:12,220
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Everything that I did not say.

1042
01:03:12,354 --> 01:03:13,922
Everything that I did, you know.
Mm-hmm.

1043
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:15,566
And probably everything
that I-I did...

1044
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:16,825
I did not... I did not do.

1045
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,660
Mm... Yeah, he's thinking.

1046
01:03:18,793 --> 01:03:21,830
Hmm... Come on. Come on.

1047
01:03:23,631 --> 01:03:25,233
Okay. Whoa.

1048
01:03:25,367 --> 01:03:27,235
Whoa! Oh.

1049
01:03:27,369 --> 01:03:28,236
Oh, no.

1050
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:29,872
Kiss her.

1051
01:03:30,005 --> 01:03:31,685
Are you gonna...
are you gonna kiss me now?

1052
01:03:31,773 --> 01:03:33,241
No. No?

1053
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:35,010
Oh, God, I'm never
doing that again.

1054
01:03:35,143 --> 01:03:36,611
God, well, maybe never.
I don't know.

1055
01:03:36,744 --> 01:03:37,846
Honestly, it's really fun.

1056
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,447
If we save the day,

1057
01:03:39,581 --> 01:03:41,059
can we call ourselves
the Lethal Protector?

1058
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:42,951
That is so '80s.
Dan, pack quickly.

1059
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:45,453
Don't stay.
And if for any reason...

1060
01:03:45,587 --> 01:03:46,788
Fire and sound.

1061
01:03:46,922 --> 01:03:48,423
"Fire and sound"?
Is that a band?

1062
01:03:48,556 --> 01:03:50,225
- No, it's what kills them.
- Yeah.

1063
01:03:50,358 --> 01:03:52,260
Okay, look, man, I've got her.

1064
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:56,764
Not sorry.

1065
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:58,666
Oh... God, I'm so sorry.

1066
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,069
Man, those two need some
serious couples counseling.

1067
01:04:05,173 --> 01:04:07,943
I'm pulling up to Brock's now.

1068
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:14,049
Shit. Oh, my God.

1069
01:04:16,184 --> 01:04:19,287
Kasady, place your hands
on your head!

1070
01:04:20,388 --> 01:04:22,324
Which, um...

1071
01:04:22,457 --> 01:04:24,426
hands?

1072
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:25,994
What the...

1073
01:04:30,665 --> 01:04:32,700
We found you.

1074
01:04:32,834 --> 01:04:35,938
Shriek will be so pleased.

1075
01:04:40,408 --> 01:04:42,410
Yoo-hoo!

1076
01:04:43,745 --> 01:04:45,780
Brockalicious.

1077
01:05:01,029 --> 01:05:03,631
Bling-a-ling.

1078
01:05:05,433 --> 01:05:08,536
Now, whose finger
were you meant for?

1079
01:05:12,707 --> 01:05:14,576
Ah.

1080
01:05:14,709 --> 01:05:17,545
A nice, shiny lure

1081
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:20,148
for a little fishy.

1082
01:05:26,788 --> 01:05:29,591
Okay. Here we go, buddy.

1083
01:05:38,066 --> 01:05:40,002
Hello, Anne.

1084
01:05:40,135 --> 01:05:42,670
I just incapacitated
your boyfriend.

1085
01:05:42,804 --> 01:05:44,339
Now, he'll be okay...

1086
01:05:44,472 --> 01:05:46,874
with an answer about
where Eddie Brock is.

1087
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:50,678
Well, I'm sure as
shit not gonna tell you that.

1088
01:05:50,812 --> 01:05:52,614
It's a shame to hurt you.

1089
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:03,025
Tell Brock
Cletus will make a swap.

1090
01:06:03,158 --> 01:06:05,627
Her head for his.

1091
01:06:07,195 --> 01:06:08,997
He's gonna kill you both.

1092
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:11,466
Peeps have tried that already.

1093
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,601
Botched it.

1094
01:06:25,313 --> 01:06:27,182
They can't find him!

1095
01:06:27,315 --> 01:06:29,184
They are hunting us, too, buddy.

1096
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:32,987
Come on, where are you?

1097
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,228
Hey, Dan. What's going on?

1098
01:06:40,362 --> 01:06:42,364
Eddie, they got her. Huh?

1099
01:06:42,497 --> 01:06:44,299
They've taken Anne! Calm down.

1100
01:06:44,432 --> 01:06:45,709
Yeah, they took her
to their wedding.

1101
01:06:45,733 --> 01:06:47,369
They took her where?
Their wedding.

1102
01:06:47,502 --> 01:06:49,371
Grace Cathedral. Hurry.
We're on our way.

1103
01:06:49,504 --> 01:06:52,307
All right, it looks like
we are going to a wedding.

1104
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,509
Oh, will there be canapés?

1105
01:06:54,642 --> 01:06:56,178
You bet your ass.

1106
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:35,717
That distant cathedral

1107
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:38,220
is all I see.

1108
01:07:40,188 --> 01:07:44,058
Fractured angel,

1109
01:07:44,192 --> 01:07:46,194
the other part of me.

1110
01:07:48,263 --> 01:07:49,964
D-Dearly beloved...

1111
01:07:50,098 --> 01:07:51,799
Gifts first.

1112
01:07:51,933 --> 01:07:53,735
Actually, traditionally...

1113
01:07:53,868 --> 01:07:56,070
Shut your mouth.

1114
01:07:57,905 --> 01:07:59,040
Father.

1115
01:07:59,174 --> 01:08:03,311
Baby, I got for you
what you want most.

1116
01:08:03,445 --> 01:08:04,912
The cop?

1117
01:08:05,046 --> 01:08:06,581
The cop.

1118
01:08:06,714 --> 01:08:07,982
Continue, Father.

1119
01:08:08,116 --> 01:08:12,086
Dearly beloved, if anyone
objects to this marriage,

1120
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:14,922
speak now
or forever hold th-their...

1121
01:08:17,392 --> 01:08:18,826
Where is she?!

1122
01:08:22,164 --> 01:08:24,031
There you are.

1123
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:26,033
Death to you, Father.

1124
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:27,034
No!

1125
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:28,870
Not you, Father.

1126
01:08:29,003 --> 01:08:31,573
You, Father.

1127
01:08:31,706 --> 01:08:33,808
Oh, shit!

1128
01:08:33,941 --> 01:08:35,610
Uh, where you going?
What are you doing?

1129
01:08:35,743 --> 01:08:37,345
This is much worse
than I thought.

1130
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:39,814
That is a red one. Wow. Uh...

1131
01:08:39,947 --> 01:08:42,217
Red one?
We should leave immediately.

1132
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:43,851
Annie will get over it.

1133
01:08:43,985 --> 01:08:46,421
We never liked her anyway.
So let's go.

1134
01:08:46,554 --> 01:08:47,689
Now?

1135
01:08:47,822 --> 01:08:48,966
Congratulations to the happy couple.

1136
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:50,124
We are leaving.

1137
01:08:50,258 --> 01:08:52,059
Eddie! Yoo-hoo.

1138
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:54,629
I'll be right with you,
all right? Mm.

1139
01:08:54,762 --> 01:08:56,631
Okay, you need
to come out right now.

1140
01:08:56,764 --> 01:08:59,634
Because I am feeling super,
super vulnerable right here.

1141
01:08:59,767 --> 01:09:01,269
Brock's just like you?

1142
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:02,770
Not for long.

1143
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:06,808
Eddie, over here!

1144
01:09:06,941 --> 01:09:08,643
You need to come out right now.

1145
01:09:08,776 --> 01:09:11,513
I will let you eat everybody.
You can eat 'em all!

1146
01:09:11,646 --> 01:09:14,382
Apart from him in the robe.
You cannot eat him.

1147
01:09:14,516 --> 01:09:16,451
Promise? I promise.

1148
01:09:19,254 --> 01:09:20,755
Thank you.

1149
01:09:34,769 --> 01:09:36,571
Baby!

1150
01:09:36,704 --> 01:09:38,540
Shut your mouth.

1151
01:09:39,641 --> 01:09:41,809
Marriage trouble already?

1152
01:09:43,811 --> 01:09:45,179
Time to die.

1153
01:09:45,313 --> 01:09:46,714
That's the spirit.

1154
01:09:46,848 --> 01:09:49,951
I mean us. We are going to die.

1155
01:10:31,826 --> 01:10:33,361
I-I killed you.

1156
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:36,264
Well, you can't kill a ghost.

1157
01:10:39,434 --> 01:10:43,838
You, kill him,
but keep your mouth shut.

1158
01:10:43,971 --> 01:10:46,808
Our wife knows what she's doing.

1159
01:10:46,941 --> 01:10:48,710
Just turn it down.

1160
01:10:48,843 --> 01:10:51,479
Who do you think
you're talking to?

1161
01:10:51,613 --> 01:10:54,516
Stop him. My cop!

1162
01:11:01,155 --> 01:11:02,524
Honeymoon over?

1163
01:11:02,657 --> 01:11:04,592
Oh, God. No.

1164
01:11:07,061 --> 01:11:08,830
Power up.

1165
01:11:08,963 --> 01:11:09,964
No!

1166
01:11:26,881 --> 01:11:29,784
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
Cletus Kasady...

1167
01:11:41,696 --> 01:11:46,801
What do they say
about an eye for an eye?

1168
01:11:56,511 --> 01:11:58,212
Fire and sound.

1169
01:11:58,346 --> 01:11:59,414
Except without the sound.

1170
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:04,419
Baby!

1171
01:12:07,021 --> 01:12:08,055
Cletus!

1172
01:12:38,152 --> 01:12:39,987
Mano a mano, Brock.

1173
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:49,597
You know how I spent
my endless days?

1174
01:12:59,807 --> 01:13:01,509
I spent them thinking about

1175
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:05,513
how you only told
one side of the story.

1176
01:13:18,225 --> 01:13:22,229
You didn't write about the part
where Cletus was abused

1177
01:13:22,363 --> 01:13:25,467
by Mommy, Daddy and Granny!

1178
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:03,437
You didn't tell the world
how he was a scared little boy

1179
01:14:03,571 --> 01:14:06,107
that no one cared about

1180
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:09,477
and no one came to save!

1181
01:14:13,347 --> 01:14:17,485
You never asked yourself why!

1182
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:21,155
That's bad journalism!

1183
01:14:28,095 --> 01:14:30,798
Oh, happy days.

1184
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:42,510
I'm not a crazy man,

1185
01:14:43,377 --> 01:14:46,948
but I am a vengeful one.

1186
01:14:50,852 --> 01:14:53,220
You're going to watch her die.

1187
01:14:59,393 --> 01:15:01,996
Anne! Anne!

1188
01:15:17,712 --> 01:15:18,712
Do something!

1189
01:15:20,715 --> 01:15:24,318
Eddie, I'm afraid
we cannot beat them.

1190
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:33,060
Baby, that's too much.

1191
01:15:34,128 --> 01:15:35,897
You got to stop him.

1192
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:37,799
What are you doing?

1193
01:15:37,932 --> 01:15:40,001
I'll shut her up for good.

1194
01:15:41,068 --> 01:15:43,738
No, stop! You're hurting her!

1195
01:15:48,342 --> 01:15:49,343
Get up!

1196
01:15:49,476 --> 01:15:51,545
I can't.

1197
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:54,481
Look. Look.

1198
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:56,684
They're not symbiotic.

1199
01:15:57,585 --> 01:15:58,585
Get away from her!

1200
01:15:58,686 --> 01:15:59,686
Shut up.

1201
01:15:59,787 --> 01:16:01,956
Get your hands off my wife!

1202
01:16:04,025 --> 01:16:06,227
They're not a match.

1203
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:07,762
We are.

1204
01:16:07,895 --> 01:16:10,732
That's right. We are.

1205
01:16:12,266 --> 01:16:14,201
Together, we are...

1206
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:18,205
The Lethal Protector!

1207
01:17:34,949 --> 01:17:39,153
Let there be carnage!

1208
01:18:00,808 --> 01:18:03,410
I got you. You okay?

1209
01:18:33,274 --> 01:18:36,811
Father, one of us must die.

1210
01:18:36,944 --> 01:18:39,246
We need fire.

1211
01:18:42,583 --> 01:18:45,152
Or sound.

1212
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,368
No!

1213
01:19:17,985 --> 01:19:21,055
Holy mackerel.

1214
01:19:57,724 --> 01:20:00,294
He did not taste good.

1215
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:14,441
I'm a killer

1216
01:20:14,575 --> 01:20:17,444
with or without
the monster, Eddie.

1217
01:20:19,646 --> 01:20:21,448
You know what I really wanted?

1218
01:20:22,749 --> 01:20:24,418
No. What was it, Cletus?

1219
01:20:24,551 --> 01:20:27,554
I told you,
but you weren't listening.

1220
01:20:28,655 --> 01:20:30,291
Well, I'm listening now.

1221
01:20:31,658 --> 01:20:34,161
I wanted your friendship.

1222
01:20:36,463 --> 01:20:38,499
I'm sorry, Cletus.

1223
01:20:40,902 --> 01:20:42,870
Fuck this guy.

1224
01:21:04,591 --> 01:21:06,827
You in there,
get him out of here.

1225
01:21:06,961 --> 01:21:08,695
They're gonna come for you both.

1226
01:21:08,829 --> 01:21:10,464
I know.

1227
01:21:11,966 --> 01:21:13,968
Hey, Anne.

1228
01:21:14,101 --> 01:21:15,937
Take care.

1229
01:21:19,273 --> 01:21:20,874
Yeah, you, too, champ.

1230
01:21:21,008 --> 01:21:22,509
Dan!

1231
01:21:22,643 --> 01:21:24,211
You take care, too.

1232
01:21:24,345 --> 01:21:25,779
Thanks.

1233
01:21:25,913 --> 01:21:27,348
I like you.

1234
01:21:27,481 --> 01:21:29,183
We totally
didn't need him, though.

1235
01:21:29,316 --> 01:21:32,954
Honestly, I think he was more
of a hindrance than a help.

1236
01:21:46,633 --> 01:21:48,535
Monsters.

1237
01:21:58,145 --> 01:21:59,947
That there is Don Quixote,

1238
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:03,350
and the guy next to him
is, uh, S-Sancho Panza.

1239
01:22:03,484 --> 01:22:05,086
They're two
very different people

1240
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:07,788
who have very different takes
on the world.

1241
01:22:07,921 --> 01:22:10,491
D-Different ways
of doing things.

1242
01:22:10,624 --> 01:22:13,060
Sometimes they didn't like
each other a whole lot,

1243
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:15,629
but ultimately...

1244
01:22:15,762 --> 01:22:19,033
they worked together to bring
out the best in each other.

1245
01:22:20,167 --> 01:22:23,937
Eddie, the time has come.

1246
01:22:24,071 --> 01:22:26,140
I must go alone.

1247
01:22:26,273 --> 01:22:28,375
It is me they want.

1248
01:22:28,509 --> 01:22:30,211
Yeah.

1249
01:22:31,378 --> 01:22:34,081
Well, my dear Sancho,

1250
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:37,384
facts are the enemy of truth.

1251
01:22:37,518 --> 01:22:39,486
What does that even mean?

1252
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:41,455
It means...

1253
01:22:42,456 --> 01:22:46,193
It means that we are...

1254
01:22:46,327 --> 01:22:48,062
- frien...
- Fugitives!

1255
01:22:48,195 --> 01:22:50,331
Um, yeah. Yeah.

1256
01:22:50,464 --> 01:22:52,699
On the run. That, too.

1257
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:09,283
Thank you for bringing me here.

1258
01:23:09,416 --> 01:23:11,885
Yeah, you're welcome, buddy.

1259
01:23:12,019 --> 01:23:13,820
It's beautiful, huh? Mm-hmm.

1260
01:23:13,954 --> 01:23:17,424
I'm sorry that we can't
do anything about the old

1261
01:23:17,558 --> 01:23:19,993
"wind in your hair"
situation, but...

1262
01:23:20,127 --> 01:23:23,530
Osho says,
when you love someone,

1263
01:23:23,664 --> 01:23:26,467
you accept the whole person...
Osho?

1264
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:29,170
With all of their defects.

1265
01:23:29,303 --> 01:23:30,804
"Defects." Hmm.

1266
01:23:30,937 --> 01:23:32,239
Nobody is perfect.

1267
01:23:32,373 --> 01:23:33,740
Just go back. Go back a minute.

1268
01:23:33,874 --> 01:23:36,543
You telling me...
you just said that you love me.

1269
01:23:36,677 --> 01:23:38,312
Um... You did.

1270
01:23:40,414 --> 01:23:42,216
Where will we go?

1271
01:23:42,349 --> 01:23:45,219
I don't know. I don't know.

1272
01:23:45,352 --> 01:23:47,988
Anywhere that needs
a Lethal Protector, I suppose.

1273
01:23:48,122 --> 01:23:50,791

01:23:50,924 --> 01:23:52,359
Yeah.

1275
01:23:52,493 --> 01:23:55,129

01:23:56,463 --> 01:23:57,564
No.

1277
01:23:57,698 --> 01:23:59,666

01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:15,462
such an insane secret, man.

1354
01:27:15,596 --> 01:27:17,831
We all have a past, Eddie.

1355
01:27:18,999 --> 01:27:22,336
What, are you...
you hiding stuff from me?

1356
01:27:22,469 --> 01:27:24,605
80 billion light-years

1357
01:27:24,738 --> 01:27:27,641
