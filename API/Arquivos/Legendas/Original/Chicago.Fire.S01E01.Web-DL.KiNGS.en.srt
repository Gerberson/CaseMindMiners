1
00:00:02,374 --> 00:00:04,809
House fire, 788 Maple Street.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,810
Engine 51, truck 81, ambulance 61.

3
00:00:17,322 --> 00:00:20,625
Guys, how do I look?

4
00:00:20,626 --> 00:00:21,626
As usual.

5
00:00:21,627 --> 00:00:24,962
Like the class clown.

6
00:00:26,164 --> 00:00:27,398
Yo, Severide,

7
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:29,767
how soon till you can
take Darden off my hands?

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,971
Andy makes squad the day after
I'm no longer in charge.

9
00:00:48,954 --> 00:00:51,022
The attic. My brother lives up there.

10
00:00:51,023 --> 00:00:52,823
- He hasn't come down.
- That window there?

11
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:53,924
Yes, I haven't seen him.

12
00:00:53,925 --> 00:00:55,159
Oh, god.

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,694
Think there's a guy in the attic.

14
00:00:56,695 --> 00:00:57,695
I'll raise the aerial.

15
00:00:57,696 --> 00:00:58,996
He could be on the stairs,

16
00:00:58,997 --> 00:01:00,131
in the hallway, anywhere.

17
00:01:00,132 --> 00:01:02,333
We'll go in back, work our way up.

18
00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:04,001
Case of beer we get to him first.

19
00:01:04,002 --> 00:01:05,136
Just vent the back.

20
00:01:05,137 --> 00:01:07,038
Was Severide always such a cocky prick?

21
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:09,306
Only since kindergarten.

22
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:17,415
This is chief Boden.

23
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,150
Want an inch and 3/4 on the front.

24
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:21,419
Need two 2 1/2s on the neighbors' houses.

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,787
I want my entrance through the rear

26
00:01:22,788 --> 00:01:25,222
and ground ladders to the roof.

27
00:01:25,223 --> 00:01:28,192
Halligan.

28
00:01:28,193 --> 00:01:32,193
Let's go!

29
00:01:33,432 --> 00:01:35,332
Hey, check over there!

30
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:36,767
Severide, do we have a vent?

31
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,903
Darden, wait.

32
00:01:38,904 --> 00:01:41,439
We're good.

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,174
Casey, there is no vent.

34
00:01:43,175 --> 00:01:45,444
Darden, back out!

35
00:01:49,948 --> 00:01:52,316
Get down!

36
00:01:56,154 --> 00:01:58,824
Darden!

37
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:21,374
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

38
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:42,032
What the hell are you doing, Casey?

39
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:44,168
Can't stand looking at this another day.

40
00:02:44,616 --> 00:02:47,652
Heather might want it.

41
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,858
Yeah. I'll call her.

44
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,242
Rumor's floating around
you're going to box

45
00:03:11,243 --> 00:03:13,577
in the drop-a-cop.

46
00:03:13,578 --> 00:03:14,845
Fight that guy who slept
with your first wife?

47
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:16,547
It was my second wife,

48
00:03:16,548 --> 00:03:17,815
and she's his problem now, not mine.

49
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:20,852
So, no, I'm not boxing him.

50
00:03:27,092 --> 00:03:28,993
Mayor Emanuel's coming by on Saturday

51
00:03:28,994 --> 00:03:32,597
to mark the month since Darden--

52
00:03:34,753 --> 00:03:38,122
This animosity... has got to stop.

53
00:03:38,123 --> 00:03:39,290
You're both supposed to be leaders here.

54
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,358
Lead by example. We've all been through it.

55
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:42,893
Andy was a friend to all of us.

56
00:03:42,894 --> 00:03:44,462
Yeah, he was.

57
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:46,731
Is there something you want to say?

58
00:03:46,732 --> 00:03:48,299
See this? This right here.

59
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,970
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

60
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:57,208
You're right, chief.

61
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:01,209
I'm sorry. It's all good.

62
00:04:01,947 --> 00:04:04,281
We're fine, chief.

63
00:04:07,352 --> 00:04:11,056
then that's enough for now.

64
00:04:20,432 --> 00:04:22,533
Hey.

65
00:04:22,534 --> 00:04:24,034
Um...

66
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:25,836
my--My name is Peter Mills.

67
00:04:25,837 --> 00:04:28,239
I'm the new candidate on 81.

68
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,508
Oh, fantastic. Joe Cruz.

69
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:31,509
We've been waiting for you.

70
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,010
- Really? Great.
- So Peter Mills?

71
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:34,779
- Is it?
- Pete, actually, I--

72
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,981
- Okay, Peter Mills, right this way.

73
00:04:36,982 --> 00:04:38,015
So, uh, gym's through there.

74
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:39,517
There's a TV in the kitchen,

75
00:04:39,518 --> 00:04:41,152
but satellite's busted.

76
00:04:41,153 --> 00:04:43,788
Uh, equipment room.

77
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:44,989
Rescue squad a-holes.

78
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,191
Think they own that table. Kitchen.

79
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:51,128
Tower.

80
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:54,432
- Peter Mills, keep moving.
- Yeah.

81
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:03,400
Hey, Otis, this is Peter Mills.

82
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,787
Yeah, I'm giving a tour.

83
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:07,448
Peter Mills is our new candidate.

84
00:05:07,795 --> 00:05:09,830
Peter Mills...

85
00:05:09,831 --> 00:05:12,834
it's all yours.

86
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:17,801
Um...

87
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:20,807
who wants to try on a helmet?

88
00:05:20,808 --> 00:05:23,243
Firehouse 51, ambulance 61.

89
00:05:23,244 --> 00:05:25,245
Multiple gunshot injuries,

90
00:05:25,246 --> 00:05:27,014
934 Roosevelt Road.

91
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:31,585
What's up?

92
00:05:31,586 --> 00:05:32,786
Two GSW's.

93
00:05:32,787 --> 00:05:34,021
One's an organ donor,
another hit in the gut.

94
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:35,556
Shooter?

95
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:36,557
Gone. But this happened
less than ten minutes ago.

96
00:05:36,558 --> 00:05:38,025
We're sweeping.

97
00:05:38,026 --> 00:05:40,795
Hey, baby. Go on, medic.

98
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,169
Oh, god. Oh, god.

99
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,704
- What's your name?
- Ricky.

100
00:05:50,705 --> 00:05:53,574
- You buying or selling, Ricky?
- Bitch, just fix me up!

101
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:55,175
Maybe we should let him bleed a while.

102
00:05:55,176 --> 00:05:57,611
I put one in that G.D.
Hit him right in the head.

103
00:05:57,612 --> 00:05:59,580
Yeah, I don't think so, Ricky. He's gone.

104
00:05:59,581 --> 00:06:00,681
No, man, I hit him.

105
00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:02,316
Hey, we think the Shooter's upstairs.

106
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:04,184
Okay, we're good here.

107
00:06:04,185 --> 00:06:06,653
Ricky, have you been using? Hm?

108
00:06:06,654 --> 00:06:08,155
We need to know so that we
don't give you something

109
00:06:08,156 --> 00:06:10,724
that can make you go into shock, okay?

110
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:13,060
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
- Rise up, fool!

111
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:15,829
I told you I shot him.

112
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:28,806
Sit down. I need to look at your head.

113
00:06:32,013 --> 00:06:35,849
It's all right, okay? I'm
just gonna take a look.

114
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,818
Just take a seat.

115
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:40,821
I just want to take a look, okay?

116
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:43,824
Your head's in bad shape,
but I'm only gonna help you

117
00:06:43,825 --> 00:06:46,393
if you drop that piece on the floor.

118
00:06:46,394 --> 00:06:49,630
You need to drop the gun or we're leaving.

119
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:52,734
- Come on.
- Not until you drop that gun.

120
00:06:55,236 --> 00:06:57,671
Drop the gun now!

121
00:06:57,672 --> 00:06:58,972
Turn around! Hands behind your back!

122
00:06:58,973 --> 00:07:02,143
Weapon secured.

123
00:07:05,313 --> 00:07:07,714
Gabriela. What can I say?

124
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:11,752
Say you'll check the closet next time.

125
00:07:11,753 --> 00:07:14,921
Throw in for cooking club.

126
00:07:14,922 --> 00:07:18,091
Hey, short arms, long pockets. Yeah, you.

127
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:19,760
How'd Herrmann get the chef job?

128
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:21,695
No gag reflex.

129
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:23,030
Otis, what happened to your tour?

130
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:26,166
Our new candidate.

131
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:28,301
So this is called a pass alarm.

132
00:07:28,302 --> 00:07:30,103
Now, if a firefighter is totally still

133
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:31,371
for more than 18 seconds,

134
00:07:31,372 --> 00:07:33,440
a loud alarm goes off until he moves again.

135
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:35,108
Why?

136
00:07:35,109 --> 00:07:37,144
Well, if he's hurt or trapped,
we'll know where to find him.

137
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:41,381
That's loud.

138
00:07:41,382 --> 00:07:44,317
See, this house is special
because it has a rescue squad.

139
00:07:44,318 --> 00:07:46,453
Squad three serves a big piece of the city.

140
00:07:46,454 --> 00:07:49,056
They're experts at water
rescue, extraction,

141
00:07:49,057 --> 00:07:50,257
pretty much everything.

142
00:07:50,258 --> 00:07:52,159
They're, like, the best of the best.

143
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,829
- Why aren't you with them?
- Well, I mean, I plan to be.

144
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,198
My father was a member
of this squad years ago.

145
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,035
Mills, right? Last to show, first to go.

146
00:08:02,036 --> 00:08:03,437
That's the rescue squad.

147
00:08:03,438 --> 00:08:04,438
You truck guys do such a good job

148
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:06,139
getting everything ready for us.

149
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,941
Why would we want to
take that away from you?

150
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:10,043
Kids, you
should know they make

151
00:08:10,044 --> 00:08:12,446
the rescue helmets extra big to
fit their heads inside them.

152
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:13,814
There are two types of firefighters.

153
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:15,148
Those who are on squad,

154
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:17,317
and those who wish they were on squad.

155
00:08:17,318 --> 00:08:20,954
- Ooh.
- Come on, kids.

156
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:22,189
Bet I get an application from him

157
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,356
by the end of the month.

158
00:08:23,357 --> 00:08:26,927
He wants you, you can have him.

159
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,820
Pin-In accident.
Columbus Drive Bridge.

160
00:08:32,821 --> 00:08:36,821
Ambulance 61, engine 51, truck 81.

161
00:08:38,126 --> 00:08:39,961
Squad three, battalion 25.

162
00:08:39,962 --> 00:08:43,599
Let's go! Let's go!

163
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:49,804
Let's go!

164
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,828
Mills, shadow Mouch.

165
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:16,297
Walk with a purpose, but don't run.

166
00:09:16,298 --> 00:09:18,633
Take it all in, know the
details of the situation

167
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:20,735
before you act.

168
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:23,137
Oh, and Mills, don't be a crow.

169
00:09:41,657 --> 00:09:43,291
- Ma'am? Can you hear me?
- My daughter--

170
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,660
Madeline?

171
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:49,030
- Hey, Cruz, grab the saw!
- Madeline! My little girl.

172
00:09:49,031 --> 00:09:50,331
I see her. She's okay.

173
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:52,199
Get the jaws!

174
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,569
This is chief Boden, I'm
gonna need two more ambulances

175
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,304
and a helicopter.

176
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:57,772
Will you find her?

177
00:09:57,773 --> 00:09:59,674
Mother, daughter trapped.
Both responsive.

178
00:09:59,675 --> 00:10:00,808
- Can you hear me?
- Madeline.

179
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,043
Madeline?

180
00:10:02,044 --> 00:10:04,045
Are you hurt, honey?

181
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:05,680
Okay, can you tell me where you're hurt?

182
00:10:05,681 --> 00:10:06,747
My body.

183
00:10:06,748 --> 00:10:09,351
We're leaking fuel!

184
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:13,054
Okay, you mean your tummy or your chest?

185
00:10:13,055 --> 00:10:14,055
My chest.

186
00:10:14,056 --> 00:10:15,890
Madeline, mommy loves you.

187
00:10:15,891 --> 00:10:18,225
Everything's gonna be okay.

188
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:19,760
Madeline, look at mommy.

189
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:21,228
Oh shh--He's in the water.

190
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:22,930
- He's in the water!
- Who?

191
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:25,267
The driver. He was ejected.

192
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,870
We think we got one in the river. Go.

193
00:10:29,871 --> 00:10:30,972
We're on it!

194
00:10:30,973 --> 00:10:32,840
Listen, Madeline, I want you to see

195
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,775
if you can turn your head toward me.

196
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:37,979
Can you do that?

197
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,914
Madeline. Madeline.

198
00:10:39,915 --> 00:10:43,619
Give me your legs.

199
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,256
It's okay.

200
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:50,725
All right, husting and me are going.

201
00:10:50,726 --> 00:10:52,293
Capp and Hadley on rit and run the line.

202
00:10:52,294 --> 00:10:55,029
It's dumping gas!

203
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,998
Come on!

204
00:10:56,999 --> 00:10:58,767
Go!

205
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:08,342
That's the driver.

206
00:11:08,343 --> 00:11:09,777
Stop that guy.

207
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:13,215
Go!

208
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:18,719
I got him. I got him.

209
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,820
We got the driver.

210
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:20,855
He's in custody.

211
00:11:20,856 --> 00:11:22,390
Cancel the dive.

212
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:25,227
No one is in the water.

213
00:11:28,664 --> 00:11:30,831
It's okay.

214
00:11:30,832 --> 00:11:32,099
- I'm scared.
- Let's get her out of here.

215
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,235
Whoa, whoa, whoa, look at her jugular.

216
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,672
It's all right, sweetie.

217
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:41,042
Muffled heart sounds.

218
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:42,243
It's Beck's triad.

219
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:43,911
Come on, sweetie. Gentle.

220
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,280
Easy. Come on.

221
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:50,951
Time.

222
00:11:50,952 --> 00:11:53,821
Less than two minutes.

223
00:11:53,822 --> 00:11:55,356
I got P.E.A.

224
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:57,058
She's bleeding into the
bag around her heart.

225
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:58,360
I need to evacuate the blood.

226
00:11:58,548 --> 00:12:00,015
- A minute and a half.
- She doesn't have

227
00:12:00,016 --> 00:12:01,217
a minute and a half, Shay.

228
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:02,218
She's gonna be dead before we get there.

229
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:03,853
You got to wait, Dawson.

230
00:12:03,854 --> 00:12:05,488
Pull over the damn rig now.

231
00:12:12,095 --> 00:12:14,029
Come on. Come on.

232
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,798
Come on. Come on.

233
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,566
Damn it. I hit the heart.

234
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:19,902
Back it out slowly.

235
00:12:19,903 --> 00:12:24,006
Slowly.

236
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,815
Pressure's coming up. Go.

237
00:12:47,803 --> 00:12:49,003
Mediastinal hemorrhage.

238
00:12:49,004 --> 00:12:51,672
I attempted pericardiocentesis
and saw PVCs.

239
00:12:51,673 --> 00:12:53,074
You hit her heart with a needle?

240
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:55,009
I backed it out and evacuated
as much blood as I could.

241
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,811
Well, let's hope you didn't
kill her in the process.

242
00:12:56,812 --> 00:12:57,845
Get her into three.

243
00:12:57,846 --> 00:12:59,013
Call Dr. Nesbit upstairs

244
00:12:59,014 --> 00:13:00,247
and tell him to prep for surgery.

245
00:13:00,248 --> 00:13:03,050
Gabby, don't worry about him.
He's an ass.

246
00:13:03,051 --> 00:13:05,353
And his wife's finally leaving
him, so there's that.

247
00:13:05,354 --> 00:13:08,390
Thanks.

248
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,694
Say, lieutenant,

249
00:13:13,695 --> 00:13:14,795
now that we have a new candidate,

250
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:15,896
I don't have to be Otis anymore.

251
00:13:15,897 --> 00:13:17,164
You're still Otis.

252
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:19,100
But I thought I could
learn to drive the truck

253
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:21,035
and we could put Peter
Mills on the elevators.

254
00:13:21,036 --> 00:13:22,970
Herrmann, what's this guy's name?

255
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:24,872
- Otis.
- No, his real name.

256
00:13:24,873 --> 00:13:27,775
Bart?

257
00:13:27,776 --> 00:13:31,412
Brian. Brian Zvonecek.

258
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:32,713
He knew.

259
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:33,748
You're staying on the elevators,

260
00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:35,750
which makes you Otis. Sorry.

261
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:37,652
Hey.

262
00:13:37,653 --> 00:13:40,121
Guy in the water?

263
00:13:40,122 --> 00:13:42,089
How about a guy with his head up his ass?

264
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,725
You handle your firefighters.
I'll handle mine.

265
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:45,860
That's a good theory, Casey.

266
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:47,294
- How about giving it a try?
- Know what?

267
00:13:47,295 --> 00:13:48,829
I'm getting real tired
of your Bull, Severide.

268
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,132
I don't give a damn what you're tired of.

269
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:53,000
Hey.

270
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:54,368
I thought you all should
know I am gonna fight

271
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:56,737
that Dick Olmstead who slept with my wife

272
00:13:56,738 --> 00:13:58,806
in Saturday's drop-a-cop.

273
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:01,175
Or we could all just throw
the gloves on right now,

274
00:14:01,176 --> 00:14:02,410
beat the hell out of each other.

275
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:05,046
Maybe when the mayor comes on Saturday

276
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:06,847
that's what he sees.

277
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:09,250
Truck versus squad--

278
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:13,251
old as the CFD, so deal with it.

279
00:14:14,222 --> 00:14:18,222
We all lost Darden a month ago Friday.

280
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,295
And that ain't changing.

281
00:14:21,296 --> 00:14:25,296
So maybe we should.

282
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:40,347
- Hey, Heather.
- Hey.

283
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:43,818
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

284
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:46,120
Thanks for meeting me out here.

285
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:47,922
I just can't go in there.

286
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:50,125
How are you?

287
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:57,933
I don't-- what do you want me to say?

288
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:00,402
So that's it, huh?

289
00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:05,937
14 years at this station,
and it all fits into a box.

290
00:15:06,808 --> 00:15:08,476
Heather, there's not
a single place I look

291
00:15:08,477 --> 00:15:11,812
and don't see him.

292
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:14,381
Bells go off, and I think,
"The truck can't leave yet.

293
00:15:14,382 --> 00:15:18,018
Andy's not on it."

294
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:20,454
Why don't you and Hallie
and I get together?

295
00:15:20,455 --> 00:15:24,455
I could use a Margarita-- or four.

296
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:26,961
Of course.

297
00:15:26,962 --> 00:15:29,998
I'll have Hallie call you.

298
00:15:57,859 --> 00:16:00,795
- Kelly.
- Yeah?

299
00:16:00,796 --> 00:16:03,832
Come here.

300
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:11,573
Here.

301
00:16:16,011 --> 00:16:18,046
- Thanks.
- Okay.

302
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:25,045
You okay, Dawson?

303
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:27,715
Uh, of course, yeah, yeah. It's, uh...

304
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:31,716
some days, you know?

305
00:17:33,355 --> 00:17:37,355
Forget it. It's all good. You?

306
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:39,360
Uh, listen, some of us are going over

307
00:17:39,361 --> 00:17:40,427
to Buzzard's tomorrow night

308
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:42,363
if you and Hallie wanna come.

309
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:46,364
We would, but, uh, we
do a date night thing.

310
00:17:47,469 --> 00:17:48,869
Just us.

311
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:52,439
But maybe we'll try.

312
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,478
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.

313
00:18:06,988 --> 00:18:08,722
Mr. Herrmann? I'm David Talbott,

314
00:18:08,723 --> 00:18:10,591
an attorney with the Sheriff's department.

315
00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:13,127
Yeah. No problem. We're all out.

316
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:14,895
There's a dryer down in the basement

317
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:16,964
I couldn't get out by myself,
but otherwise, you know--

318
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:19,400
- We'll take care of it.

319
00:18:19,401 --> 00:18:23,401
Oh, no, uh, we'll change the locks.

320
00:18:23,805 --> 00:18:26,841
Yeah, right.

321
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,632
Hey.

322
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:55,636
Pizza again?

323
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:58,806
You can't live like that.

324
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:03,610
Come on in.

325
00:19:03,611 --> 00:19:07,649
I've only got a few
minutes before my shift.

326
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:17,221
I...I can't wear this if I'm
not still engaged to you.

327
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:23,865
Am I?

328
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:27,468
You tell anyone I moved out?

329
00:19:27,469 --> 00:19:31,469
No. You?

330
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:33,807
No.

331
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:34,975
So what are we doing?

332
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:37,010
I'd marry you tomorrow, Hallie,

333
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:38,946
if I knew we wanted the same things.

334
00:19:38,947 --> 00:19:39,980
I'm a resident, Matt.

335
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:41,048
I cannot start a family right now.

336
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:45,086
Yeah, that's been made perfectly clear.

337
00:19:47,088 --> 00:19:51,088
So what are we doing?

338
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:54,963
I don't know.

339
00:19:57,966 --> 00:20:00,101
Call me when you do.

340
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:10,611
Yo, Peter Mills!

341
00:20:10,612 --> 00:20:12,980
My partner, Shay, she's
been asking about you.

342
00:20:12,981 --> 00:20:14,114
Been talking about you all morning.

343
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:15,115
I heard she's a monster.

344
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:16,583
Dude I know over at 19,

345
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:17,985
he walked with a hitch for a week.

346
00:20:17,986 --> 00:20:21,154
Ah, you guys are busting my balls.

347
00:20:21,155 --> 00:20:23,557
Listen to me, kid.

348
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:25,158
I just lost my house to foreclosure

349
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:27,094
because I took a bath in the market.

350
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:28,996
We're now living with my in-laws,

351
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:30,597
which is two bedrooms shy of unpleasant.

352
00:20:30,598 --> 00:20:32,165
My wife won't take her birth control

353
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,034
because the Pope said if
she did, god would cry,

354
00:20:34,035 --> 00:20:35,769
so I'm not having any sex.

355
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,604
So if there's any chance

356
00:20:37,605 --> 00:20:40,073
that I could live vicariously through you,

357
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:42,310
it's literally all I got.

358
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:49,717
All right.

359
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,624
Hey.

360
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,259
- Hey.
- I'm Peter Mills.

361
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,828
Uh...Pete.

362
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:04,131
Uh-huh. Peter Mills.

363
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:05,332
Can you hand me that box right there?

364
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,269
Uh, yeah.

365
00:21:09,604 --> 00:21:12,139
Thanks.

366
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,908
So the little girl from the
bridge accident, she okay?

367
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:16,910
You really are new, aren't you?

368
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:18,712
Listen.

369
00:21:18,713 --> 00:21:20,914
We get 'em to the doctor best we can,

370
00:21:20,915 --> 00:21:22,182
and then we move on.

371
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:24,117
It's the only way to make it here.

372
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:27,054
Uh, yeah Yeah.

373
00:21:27,055 --> 00:21:29,656
So, um... I was thinking--

374
00:21:29,657 --> 00:21:32,926
I mean, I was wondering...

375
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:35,929
do you maybe wanna hook up for a beer

376
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,165
or dinner or something?

377
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,800
Peter Mills, are you gay?

378
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:41,802
Me? No.

379
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:43,904
Because I am.

380
00:21:50,345 --> 00:21:52,846
Dawson. Shay.

381
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:54,794
Which one of you put a
needle in the girl's heart?

382
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,766
Give me a minute.

383
00:22:11,703 --> 00:22:13,837
Tell me what happened.

384
00:22:13,838 --> 00:22:17,241
Her heart was stopping,
and we pulled over,

385
00:22:17,242 --> 00:22:20,244
and I did what I had to do.

386
00:22:20,245 --> 00:22:22,179
It was the right thing to do.

387
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,782
Chief surgeon at Lakeshore disagrees.

388
00:22:25,783 --> 00:22:27,518
Do you know who your union rep is?

389
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:28,852
What?

390
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:31,188
Get him involved right
now, just as a precaution.

391
00:22:31,189 --> 00:22:33,724
Maybe this goes away.

392
00:22:33,725 --> 00:22:35,125
Just in case it doesn't.

393
00:22:35,126 --> 00:22:38,662
Chief...

394
00:22:38,663 --> 00:22:41,766
You two stick together.

395
00:22:46,905 --> 00:22:48,305
How long were you the candidate here?

396
00:22:48,306 --> 00:22:49,873
Not long, four years.

397
00:22:49,874 --> 00:22:52,142
I can't believe we're gonna
miss the fights tonight.

398
00:22:52,143 --> 00:22:53,877
Well, that's just as well,
'cause I just found out

399
00:22:53,878 --> 00:22:55,579
he fought golden gloves.

400
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,314
That was 20 years ago, chief.
We gotta tape it or something.

401
00:22:57,315 --> 00:23:00,784
We gotta see it.

402
00:23:00,785 --> 00:23:02,286
What's the lieutenant doing?

403
00:23:02,287 --> 00:23:04,956
He said he wanted to cook
the Saturday corned beef.

404
00:23:07,158 --> 00:23:09,226
Ah, look at that.

405
00:23:09,227 --> 00:23:10,727
He made the best chicken parmigiana

406
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:12,162
I ever put in my mouth.

407
00:23:12,163 --> 00:23:13,864
What do you got there, Casey?

408
00:23:13,865 --> 00:23:15,299
Don't you worry about it.

409
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,335
Call everyone to chow.

410
00:23:18,903 --> 00:23:22,172
Hey, Casey's in there cooking.

411
00:23:22,173 --> 00:23:25,009
- Casey?
- Yeah.

412
00:23:35,987 --> 00:23:37,822
Have at it.

413
00:23:57,041 --> 00:24:01,011
What the hell's going on? You okay?

414
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:02,079
'Cause if you're not, maybe you need to--

415
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,381
- You think I need your help?

416
00:24:04,382 --> 00:24:06,917
I'm trying here, Severide.

417
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:08,987
Keep on.

418
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,726
I cleaned out Darden's locker.

419
00:24:17,228 --> 00:24:18,695
You should have vented the back.

420
00:24:18,696 --> 00:24:20,697
We're called the rescue squad, Casey.

421
00:24:20,698 --> 00:24:22,165
We don't vent.

422
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:25,702
You shouldn't have put
Andy through the window.

423
00:24:25,703 --> 00:24:27,104
I don't have to explain myself to you.

424
00:24:27,105 --> 00:24:30,907
I sleep like a baby.

425
00:24:30,908 --> 00:24:33,945
You?

426
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:42,753
Say, Herrmann.

427
00:24:42,754 --> 00:24:44,721
You think maybe you just bought
a little too much house?

428
00:24:44,722 --> 00:24:47,824
I was preyed upon by
low-interest loan vultures.

429
00:24:47,825 --> 00:24:49,059
What time is the mayor coming?

430
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,394
I heard 9:00.

431
00:24:50,395 --> 00:24:52,129
I heard he stops to take a piss

432
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,397
at every house in the city,

433
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:55,198
- as a sign of respect.
- Stopped here in June.

434
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:59,199
Hey, Boden's about to
fight in ten minutes.

435
00:25:01,739 --> 00:25:03,740
Screw it.

436
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:05,042
Let's take a ride.

437
00:25:05,043 --> 00:25:06,043
Take a ride. All right.

438
00:25:06,044 --> 00:25:07,210
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

439
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:11,915
Fighting in the red corner,

440
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:13,150
for the Chicago fire department,

441
00:25:13,151 --> 00:25:17,151
chief Bo-Bo-Bo-Boden.

442
00:25:18,156 --> 00:25:19,723
Hello, sports fans.

443
00:25:19,724 --> 00:25:21,425
This is Brian Zvonecek,

444
00:25:21,426 --> 00:25:24,761
coming to you live from the
annual battle of the badges.

445
00:25:24,762 --> 00:25:27,164
- Firefighters versus the police.
- What's that?

446
00:25:27,165 --> 00:25:28,899
I hope you all are ready for this.

447
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,033
That's Otis.

448
00:25:30,034 --> 00:25:32,202
Boden looks like a heat-seeking missile

449
00:25:32,203 --> 00:25:33,804
as he climbs in the ring

450
00:25:33,805 --> 00:25:36,707
to take on captain Olmstead from the cpd.

451
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:38,341
Olmstead, of course,

452
00:25:38,342 --> 00:25:39,743
looks like the quivering
cop slob that he is.

453
00:25:41,045 --> 00:25:44,047
Chief Boden first won back in 1992,

454
00:25:44,048 --> 00:25:45,916
when he was part of the esteemed truck 81,

455
00:25:45,917 --> 00:25:47,951
the greatest truck in all of Chicago.

456
00:25:47,952 --> 00:25:50,987
Mouch.

457
00:25:50,988 --> 00:25:52,155
I can't keep making excuses for ya.

458
00:25:53,224 --> 00:25:56,893
There goes the bell, and here we go.

459
00:25:56,894 --> 00:25:58,228
Takes two quick jabs to the nose.

460
00:25:58,229 --> 00:25:59,362
Oh, he falls back into the ropes.

461
00:25:59,363 --> 00:26:01,932
One, two, three to the Chin.

462
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:04,468
Boden's in trouble already, folks.

463
00:26:04,469 --> 00:26:07,871
Wait. Here it comes.

464
00:26:07,872 --> 00:26:10,340
Three straight lefts...

465
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:13,376
Accident. Building fire.
241 Franklin Street.

466
00:26:13,377 --> 00:26:16,079
Ambulance 61, engine 51.

467
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,180
That's just down the block.

468
00:26:17,181 --> 00:26:19,916
81 responding. We're rolling.

469
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:21,351
Copy that, 81.

470
00:26:24,188 --> 00:26:26,490
Engine 51 responding.

471
00:26:26,491 --> 00:26:29,961
Ambulance 61 en route to scene.

472
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:41,071
Squad three responding to
Franklin Street building fire.

473
00:26:50,982 --> 00:26:55,485
Wow, this is bad, bad, bad.

474
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:03,226
Let's go, let's go!

475
00:27:03,227 --> 00:27:04,561
Otis, get to the elevator

476
00:27:04,562 --> 00:27:06,129
and tell us what we're looking at.

477
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:10,033
Mills, help Cruz vent the roof.

478
00:27:10,034 --> 00:27:12,202
Herrmann, you and me to the top floor

479
00:27:12,203 --> 00:27:13,270
and work our way down.

480
00:27:13,271 --> 00:27:15,306
Let's move.

481
00:27:27,185 --> 00:27:29,553
Keep moving.

482
00:27:29,554 --> 00:27:31,354
Two coming out.

483
00:27:31,355 --> 00:27:35,326
Let's go, Herrmann. Second
floor, clear the doors.

484
00:27:54,478 --> 00:27:57,480
Fire department! Anyone here?

485
00:28:00,918 --> 00:28:03,486
Hey. Slow breaths.

486
00:28:03,487 --> 00:28:06,490
Okay?

487
00:28:13,464 --> 00:28:16,099
Elevator one is clear!

488
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,868
Something's keeping it open.

489
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:19,903
We got an open door on five!

490
00:28:19,904 --> 00:28:21,271
Let's clear it!

491
00:28:21,272 --> 00:28:23,340
Otis and Vargas heading up to five.

492
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:24,608
Elevator obstruction.

493
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:28,178
Gimme a diagonal stripe right here.

494
00:28:31,282 --> 00:28:34,317
Fire department! Anyone here?

495
00:28:34,318 --> 00:28:38,188
Call out!

496
00:28:38,189 --> 00:28:40,657
Help us!

497
00:28:40,658 --> 00:28:44,128
We're under here!

498
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,598
It's gonna be all right.
We'll get you out.

499
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,233
Come on.

500
00:28:50,234 --> 00:28:52,135
Watch your head, sweetie.

501
00:28:52,136 --> 00:28:53,637
I gotcha.

502
00:28:56,107 --> 00:28:59,042
Woman down!

503
00:29:00,044 --> 00:29:03,146
Think you can walk?

504
00:29:03,147 --> 00:29:05,548
Go to the nice guy. Go to Mouch.

505
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:07,150
- There you go.
- He's all right.

506
00:29:07,151 --> 00:29:09,486
Truck 81, we need two more alarms.

507
00:29:09,487 --> 00:29:10,487
We're going back in.

508
00:29:10,488 --> 00:29:14,157
Let's go.

509
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,460
Hey! Use your axe!

510
00:29:21,265 --> 00:29:23,566
I'll take her.

511
00:29:31,442 --> 00:29:35,011
It's ready to vent! Back up!

512
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:43,018
Roof is open.

513
00:29:47,022 --> 00:29:49,824
It's too hot! We gotta go now!

514
00:29:49,825 --> 00:29:53,261
Everybody out, out! Let
'em get hoses on it!

515
00:29:58,133 --> 00:29:59,967
Rescue squad is two minutes out.

516
00:29:59,968 --> 00:30:01,431
Ambo team, what do you have?

517
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:03,871
Cruz and Mills are
headed down from the roof.

518
00:30:03,872 --> 00:30:05,873
Otis, Vargas, Casey, and Herrmann

519
00:30:05,874 --> 00:30:07,775
are clear on floor four and headed down.

520
00:30:07,776 --> 00:30:10,578
No, no, no, they gotta go up.

521
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:13,080
Smoke's gone black.

522
00:30:13,081 --> 00:30:14,882
Casey, up.

523
00:30:14,883 --> 00:30:16,183
Go up to the roof.

524
00:30:16,184 --> 00:30:17,885
Casey, do you copy?

525
00:30:17,886 --> 00:30:19,186
Up, up, we can't go down.

526
00:30:19,187 --> 00:30:20,221
Move.

527
00:30:20,222 --> 00:30:22,690
Go, move, go.

528
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,200
Casey!

529
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:35,088
Herrmann!

530
00:30:48,372 --> 00:30:50,740
Rescue squad on scene.

531
00:30:54,133 --> 00:30:57,101
We have at least two not
moving in the basement,

532
00:30:57,102 --> 00:30:58,503
Casey and Herrmann.

533
00:30:58,504 --> 00:30:59,971
We'll get 'em.

534
00:30:59,972 --> 00:31:01,806
Squad three, moving in.

535
00:31:01,807 --> 00:31:04,209
Hold engines until men are clear.

536
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:19,557
Up here!

537
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:21,025
Up here!

538
00:31:21,026 --> 00:31:24,696
Go up!

539
00:31:24,697 --> 00:31:25,830
This is Severide, I need a ladder

540
00:31:25,831 --> 00:31:28,566
on the west side window, fifth floor.

541
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:30,802
I see Casey and Herrmann.

542
00:31:30,803 --> 00:31:34,139
Give me ropes. I'm going down.

543
00:31:36,008 --> 00:31:39,144
Come on, let's go, let's go.

544
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,850
Okay.

545
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:46,985
Down, down.

546
00:31:46,986 --> 00:31:49,621
Lower.

547
00:31:49,622 --> 00:31:52,690
Okay, I'm down. Offline.

548
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:55,059
Come on, get up.

549
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,595
You don't wanna miss the mayor's visit.

550
00:31:57,596 --> 00:31:59,831
You're cooking down here.

551
00:31:59,832 --> 00:32:01,966
Hey! You all right?

552
00:32:01,967 --> 00:32:04,602
Herrmann!

553
00:32:04,603 --> 00:32:06,971
Herrmann!

554
00:32:06,972 --> 00:32:09,240
Turn him.

555
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:12,578
Hey, his air!

556
00:32:17,683 --> 00:32:19,150
- Take a breath, Herrmann.
- Breathe, Buddy.

557
00:32:19,151 --> 00:32:21,921
Hey, get me another line down here!

558
00:32:27,326 --> 00:32:31,329
Guys, need a lift?

559
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,731
That's the last resident.
Building's clear.

560
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:35,300
Got her.

561
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:39,237
Thanks, Buddy.

562
00:32:39,238 --> 00:32:41,639
Hey!

563
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,842
Get him up!

564
00:32:46,312 --> 00:32:47,846
Watch his head!

565
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:51,350
Let's get him up. Let's go.

566
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:02,027
Hey!

567
00:33:45,104 --> 00:33:48,406
I got you, lieutenant.

568
00:33:48,407 --> 00:33:50,208
Come on.

569
00:33:55,047 --> 00:33:57,082
All right.

570
00:34:14,066 --> 00:34:16,134
I'm okay.

571
00:34:16,135 --> 00:34:18,202
I'm okay.

572
00:34:18,203 --> 00:34:20,138
I'm okay.

573
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:21,773
You're okay.

574
00:34:21,774 --> 00:34:23,041
I'm okay.

575
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:25,743
You're gonna be all right.

576
00:34:25,744 --> 00:34:28,846
That's right, Herrmann,
you're fine, okay?

577
00:34:28,847 --> 00:34:31,684
Tension pneumothorax.

578
00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:40,826
Don't think. Just do it.

579
00:34:43,896 --> 00:34:47,896
All right, stay with me, Christopher.

580
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,867
Stay with me.

581
00:34:49,868 --> 00:34:50,935
He's probably got other internal damage.

582
00:34:50,936 --> 00:34:53,204
Help me get him inside.

583
00:35:05,184 --> 00:35:08,219
Clear! Squad Three, truck 81 are clear.

584
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,924
- Roger that.
- Open up the hoses.

585
00:35:17,062 --> 00:35:20,398
- How's Herrmann?
- On his way to Lakeshore.

586
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:33,077
I need another leader line!

587
00:35:40,335 --> 00:35:42,737
Nice work, candidate.

588
00:35:42,738 --> 00:35:45,106
Thanks.

589
00:35:45,107 --> 00:35:48,142
Now start packing up our gear.

590
00:35:49,611 --> 00:35:53,611
Looks like we're gonna
meet the mayor after all.

591
00:36:26,406 --> 00:36:29,308
Do you think there's gonna be a hearing?

592
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:33,312
Okay. Thank you.

593
00:36:33,313 --> 00:36:35,214
Union?

594
00:36:35,215 --> 00:36:37,083
Yeah, yeah.

595
00:36:37,084 --> 00:36:40,386
Uh, they're starting a file on me.

596
00:36:40,387 --> 00:36:42,688
I'm going to the hospital
to check in on Herrmann,

597
00:36:42,689 --> 00:36:46,192
if you want to come.

598
00:36:46,193 --> 00:36:47,660
What do you know?

599
00:36:47,661 --> 00:36:51,698
I know we can't lose another one.

600
00:37:07,848 --> 00:37:10,851
Furlough requests.

601
00:37:12,185 --> 00:37:15,254
Hell of a first day, Mills.

602
00:37:15,255 --> 00:37:17,123
You handled yourself.

603
00:37:17,124 --> 00:37:21,460
Rest of the truck will remember that.

604
00:37:21,461 --> 00:37:25,331
Thank you, chief.

605
00:37:25,332 --> 00:37:26,866
Uh...

606
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:28,734
chief, one other thing.

607
00:37:28,735 --> 00:37:30,336
I was talking about the rescue squad,

608
00:37:30,337 --> 00:37:33,339
and lieutenant Casey told
me not to be a crow.

609
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,842
You know what that means?

610
00:37:36,843 --> 00:37:39,512
Oh, did he?

611
00:37:39,513 --> 00:37:41,847
A crow wanted to be a peacock,

612
00:37:41,848 --> 00:37:43,749
so he put on colored feathers

613
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,351
and went over to the peacock yard,

614
00:37:45,352 --> 00:37:47,753
but the peacocks,

615
00:37:47,754 --> 00:37:49,822
they plucked them all away.

616
00:37:49,823 --> 00:37:51,624
So the crow,

617
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:54,894
he tried to get back with the crows.

618
00:37:54,895 --> 00:37:57,530
They wanted nothing to do with him.

619
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,800
My mom used to tell me
to keep my mouth shut

620
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:04,637
and just watch.

621
00:38:04,638 --> 00:38:07,841
I'm glad I have you here to watch, chief.

622
00:38:55,956 --> 00:38:57,590
Any update?

623
00:38:57,591 --> 00:38:59,558
He's in surgery, trying
to find the bleed.

624
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:02,228
They don't know.

625
00:39:02,229 --> 00:39:03,662
I got her into four. She's 190 over 80,

626
00:39:03,663 --> 00:39:04,863
so let's keep a watch on her.

627
00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:06,866
All right.

628
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:11,937
- Hey, doc.
- Yes?

629
00:39:11,938 --> 00:39:13,606
Um, Dawson,

630
00:39:13,607 --> 00:39:15,841
what was the name of that
little girl from the bridge?

631
00:39:15,842 --> 00:39:18,478
Casey, don't.

632
00:39:19,846 --> 00:39:22,281
Madeline. That was her name.

633
00:39:22,282 --> 00:39:24,416
A little girl named Madeline,

634
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:25,618
pin-In from the Columbus drive bridge.

635
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:28,787
Where is she?

636
00:39:32,492 --> 00:39:34,827
Madeline Pokress. Vitals are stable.

637
00:39:34,828 --> 00:39:36,729
Released by the end of the week.

638
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,665
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

639
00:39:43,036 --> 00:39:45,504
- Anything change?
- He's still in surgery.

640
00:39:45,505 --> 00:39:48,374
Called his family, they're
on their way from Wheaton.

641
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:52,779
Come get me if there's an update.

642
00:40:14,801 --> 00:40:17,837
What are you doing?

643
00:40:19,005 --> 00:40:21,573
Just...

644
00:40:21,574 --> 00:40:25,611
wanted to hear your voice.

645
00:40:25,612 --> 00:40:27,646
How was your shift?

646
00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:31,016
It was fine. Typical.

647
00:40:31,017 --> 00:40:32,551
What is it, Matt?

648
00:40:36,623 --> 00:40:39,625
Do you think maybe you could find a reason

649
00:40:39,626 --> 00:40:43,028
