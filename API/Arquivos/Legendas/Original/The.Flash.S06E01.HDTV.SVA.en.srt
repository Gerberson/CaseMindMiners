1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,041
Last season, on "The Flash"...

2
00:00:06,044 --> 00:00:06,906
Hey, Mom and Dad.

3
00:00:06,909 --> 00:00:08,160
If you're watching this,

4
00:00:08,163 --> 00:00:10,033
it means that something went wrong.

5
00:00:10,036 --> 00:00:12,726
- Mom, what's happening?
- A new timeline is setting in.

6
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:14,791
- Thank you for everything.
- I love you.

7
00:00:17,803 --> 00:00:20,463
Look, Kamilla, I don't want
to keep this from you anymore.

8
00:00:20,466 --> 00:00:23,342
If being Vibe is a part
of the life you want,

9
00:00:23,345 --> 00:00:24,918
I would never get in the way of that.

10
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:25,903
I wanna take the cure.

11
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:28,222
Killer Frost and I are
really gonna miss Vibe.

12
00:00:28,225 --> 00:00:30,142
Me, too.

13
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:31,924
Dad...

14
00:00:31,927 --> 00:00:34,302
I would like my
replacement to be you, Joe.

15
00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:36,429
- As captain?
- Captain Joe West.

16
00:00:36,432 --> 00:00:39,027
None of you can stop
what's been set into motion

17
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,529
because nothing you can do

18
00:00:40,532 --> 00:00:44,061
can alter what's about to happen.

19
00:00:47,994 --> 00:00:50,828
It's a system-wide power surge.

20
00:00:56,094 --> 00:00:58,469
It's coming from the Time Vault.

21
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:03,768
- Are we under attack?
- I don't know.

22
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:06,176
Whatever's going on
started the moment we left.

23
00:01:07,296 --> 00:01:09,463
I wasn't perfect.

24
00:01:09,465 --> 00:01:12,758
Please remember that I love you both...

25
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,351
and I always will.

26
00:01:14,353 --> 00:01:15,686
And I always will.

27
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:17,688
And I always will... always... always...

28
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:30,293
Barry, Nora's message.

29
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:36,073
- Synced and corrected by VitoSilans -
-- www.Addic7ed.com --

30
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:37,898
Why is it every time I come to visit

31
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:39,288
there's always a crisis?

32
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,372
Comes with the meta-territory.

33
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,926
750 mph. He's getting faster.

34
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:45,975
Who is this guy, anyway?

35
00:01:45,977 --> 00:01:47,586
An old family friend.

36
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:53,782
His name's Godspeed, and
he's from the future.

37
00:01:56,062 --> 00:01:58,261
He's like a fake speedster.

38
00:01:58,263 --> 00:02:00,222
What's that?

39
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,902
The real deal.

40
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:22,378
Kick his butt, Barry!

41
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,546
Done and doner.

42
00:02:38,196 --> 00:02:41,054
Who are you and what are
you doing in Central City?

43
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:50,521
He's just like the others: no
language skills, just noise.

44
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:52,694
- Lovely.
- What was that?

45
00:02:52,697 --> 00:02:54,877
The fourth Godspeed
we've caught this summer

46
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,961
and still no sign of Mr. August Heart.

47
00:02:56,964 --> 00:02:58,997
Just another dummy who
can't communicate anything

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,457
beyond modem speak.

49
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:02,591
All right, I'm clocking out.

50
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:05,411
Why don't you drop off
G4 at Iron Heights, Barry?

51
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:09,007
I don't think we're figuring
out this mystery today.

52
00:03:10,513 --> 00:03:11,965
This is nice, Dad.

53
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:13,302
We should do this way more often.

54
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:14,379
Agreed.

55
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:16,047
Hey, before I forget,

56
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:17,934
congratulations on "The Citizen."

57
00:03:17,937 --> 00:03:19,125
Yeah, well, you know,

58
00:03:19,128 --> 00:03:20,578
there's millions of
people in Central City

59
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,904
and I've only got a couple
hundred thousand subscribers.

60
00:03:22,907 --> 00:03:24,431
You know, I'm no CCPN.

61
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:26,752
Well, not yet, but in about ten years

62
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:29,101
it'll be a Pulitzer Prize-winning empire.

63
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:31,155
Baby steps, Dad.

64
00:03:31,157 --> 00:03:33,416
Mm, damn, this is good.

65
00:03:33,418 --> 00:03:35,166
You know you can't get drunk.

66
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:36,920
I don't even care,
that's how good this is.

67
00:03:36,923 --> 00:03:39,403
Never fear, the party's here!

68
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,821
We brought my famous ambrosia salad

69
00:03:42,824 --> 00:03:44,168
and veggie dogs for Ralph.

70
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,502
Guys, Ralph's still in Peru.

71
00:03:45,504 --> 00:03:47,569
Or Monaco... or Texas?

72
00:03:47,572 --> 00:03:48,930
All that for a missing person's case?

73
00:03:48,932 --> 00:03:50,456
That's dedication.

74
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:53,644
Guys, guys, what are we doing?

75
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:56,474
Baby Jenna is napping
like a little angel

76
00:03:56,477 --> 00:03:58,591
and I have creamed corn,
I have candied yams,

77
00:03:58,593 --> 00:04:01,159
I have collard greens.

78
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:03,012
- Baby, let's eat.
- Yum!

79
00:04:03,014 --> 00:04:06,039
Yeah!

80
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,384
- How's the MAC coming?
- There's mac and cheese too?

81
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:21,011
No, the Mental Augmentation Chamber.

82
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:23,390
Basically, it allows us
to tap into the Speed Force

83
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:24,968
to boost Barry's cognitive abilities.

84
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:27,685
It would allow him to see every
possible outcome to a scenario

85
00:04:27,688 --> 00:04:28,716
at the same time.

86
00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:29,748
So speed-thinking.

87
00:04:29,751 --> 00:04:31,728
Which means we'll be able
to catch all the bad guys faster.

88
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,262
With all the ones that
you brought in this summer,

89
00:04:33,264 --> 00:04:35,358
Barry, the DA's office can
barely keep up with you.

90
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:36,509
Hey, since the MAC's done,

91
00:04:36,512 --> 00:04:37,845
we should take it for a test run.

92
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:38,982
Absolutely not.

93
00:04:38,985 --> 00:04:40,458
You know we're still
working out diagnostics.

94
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,051
We could put in a few hours tonight,

95
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:42,953
get a head start.

96
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:44,267
Barry...

97
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,812
If there's anything I've learned

98
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:47,440
since leaving Vibe behind,

99
00:04:47,443 --> 00:04:50,035
it's that we all have a
work-life balance to protect,

100
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:53,948
and right now, mine is
tipping towards more beer.

101
00:04:56,788 --> 00:04:59,599
Besides, I still gotta
tweak the mainframe

102
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:03,145
and I can't do that without...

103
00:05:03,148 --> 00:05:04,407
Uh...

104
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:06,483
Every time.

105
00:05:06,485 --> 00:05:08,411
- My tablet.
- Yeah.

106
00:05:08,413 --> 00:05:11,021
Thank you.

107
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:13,398
I'm gonna go get that beer.

108
00:05:16,297 --> 00:05:18,087
Hey, so the last time
I talked to you guys,

109
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:21,331
you seemed good.

110
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,427
You guys good?

111
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:26,503
Um...

112
00:05:26,505 --> 00:05:28,079
we were devastated at first,

113
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:29,895
but Nora's only gone for right now.

114
00:05:29,898 --> 00:05:31,189
We're gonna have kids someday

115
00:05:31,192 --> 00:05:34,210
and then we'll have another Nora.

116
00:05:34,213 --> 00:05:37,098
Yeah, I think knowing that
we have a second chance

117
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:38,768
makes all the difference.

118
00:05:40,345 --> 00:05:43,537
I gotta go, a break-in
at Eastside Industrial.

119
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,541
Dad, um, I meant to ask you,

120
00:05:47,543 --> 00:05:49,732
what did you do with those boxes

121
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:51,086
that were in the back of the garage?

122
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:54,431
Oh, he finally threw them away.

123
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:56,299
Thank you very much.

124
00:05:56,301 --> 00:05:57,585
Okay, I gotta make a call.

125
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:02,181
Guys, I'm sorry, I actually
have to sneak out too.

126
00:06:02,184 --> 00:06:04,735
A friend of mine from med
school needs my support.

127
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:07,238
Thanks for having me, it was delicious.

128
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,334
Bye, Caitlin.

129
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,190
You notice ain't nobody help clean up?

130
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,405
My name is Ramsey Rosso,

131
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:21,408
and my mother, Dr. Rachel Rosso,

132
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,460
was everything to me.

133
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:26,055
When I was seven,

134
00:06:26,057 --> 00:06:28,081
I skidded out pretty badly
on a bike she bought me

135
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,751
for my birthday.

136
00:06:30,753 --> 00:06:32,711
Imagine a scared kid
with two scraped knees

137
00:06:32,713 --> 00:06:34,629
and a bloody nose.

138
00:06:34,631 --> 00:06:38,216
When Mum found me,
she picked me right up,

139
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:40,403
she brushed me off,

140
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:43,906
and told me to get back
on my bike and ride.

141
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:48,911
I tried, but I couldn't.

142
00:06:48,913 --> 00:06:50,896
It was almost like I was paralyzed,

143
00:06:50,898 --> 00:06:53,190
it hurt so bad.

144
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:56,919
That's when she told
me that I would heal.

145
00:06:56,921 --> 00:07:00,071
That I must never let
a little pain stop me

146
00:07:00,073 --> 00:07:02,591
from getting to where
I needed to go in life,

147
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:05,786
and she was right.

148
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:08,246
I did heal.

149
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,676
Enough to grow up

150
00:07:12,678 --> 00:07:14,920
and follow in her footsteps.

151
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:21,610
And even though a
beautiful life was cut short

152
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:24,447
when she lost her
battle to heal herself...

153
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:29,785
She is still helping me to get
to where I need to go today.

154
00:07:37,962 --> 00:07:40,463
And for that, I will always be grateful.

155
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:45,951
Thank you, Jonathan.

156
00:07:45,953 --> 00:07:48,304
Ramsey, hi.

157
00:07:49,832 --> 00:07:52,141
I'm so sorry for your loss.

158
00:07:52,143 --> 00:07:53,891
Your mother was an incredible woman.

159
00:07:53,894 --> 00:07:55,385
I'm gonna miss her.

160
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:57,504
It means so much that you came.

161
00:07:57,506 --> 00:08:00,674
Mum actually saw something
of herself in you.

162
00:08:00,676 --> 00:08:02,806
Probably because you're
both overachievers.

163
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:06,680
Your hands are so cold.

164
00:08:08,308 --> 00:08:10,567
Are you all right?

165
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,955
Yeah, sorry, I'm fine.

166
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,665
Um, probably just coming
down with something.

167
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,167
Well, I hope not.

168
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:20,610
- Doctors make rubbish patients.
- Mm.

169
00:08:20,612 --> 00:08:22,362
It was nice to see you.

170
00:08:22,364 --> 00:08:25,824
Eh, Caitlin?

171
00:08:25,826 --> 00:08:28,919
Things have been a bit, um, crazy.

172
00:08:31,206 --> 00:08:34,207
Do you fancy coming around
for a cuppa sometime?

173
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:37,067
You know, for a proper catch-up.

174
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,209
I could really use someone
to talk to right now.

175
00:08:39,212 --> 00:08:40,630
Of course, any time.

176
00:08:40,632 --> 00:08:43,508
Just give me a call.

177
00:08:53,704 --> 00:08:56,187
Well, my log says that
your father's stuff

178
00:08:56,189 --> 00:08:58,749
should have ended up
somewhere around here.

179
00:09:04,989 --> 00:09:07,908
There it is.

180
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,271
Must be pretty important.

181
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:24,066
Yeah, it is.

182
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:26,092
Thanks.

183
00:09:33,894 --> 00:09:37,228
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

184
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,883
H-hang on!

185
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:41,917
I've got you!

186
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:59,101
You okay?

187
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,903
What the hell?

188
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:16,895
I missed you last night.
Are you sure you're okay?

189
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:18,155
Yeah.

190
00:10:18,157 --> 00:10:21,683
What were you doing out here anyway?

191
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:24,402
I was following up on a lead.

192
00:10:24,404 --> 00:10:26,527
"The Citizen" got a tip

193
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,541
that there were a series
of junkyard robberies.

194
00:10:29,543 --> 00:10:33,778
People file police
reports for stolen trash?

195
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:36,163
Yeah, well, you know,

196
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,195
not everything that's here is garbage.

197
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:44,706
Everything here is garbage!

198
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,416
I hate garbage.

199
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:48,209
Okay, have fun with Ghostbusters.

200
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:49,853
- I'll see you at home.
- Mm-hmm.

201
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,549
What do you got?

202
00:10:54,551 --> 00:10:57,218
This site is littered...
no pun intended...

203
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,197
with gamma rays and magnetar fields.

204
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:02,181
What are you saying?
Iris was attacked by a...

205
00:11:02,184 --> 00:11:05,369
Yeah, a frakkin' black hole.

206
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:15,027
That is a whole lot of
information to disseminate.

207
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:16,696
No one's ever
extrapolated this much data

208
00:11:16,698 --> 00:11:17,856
from a black hole before.

209
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:20,458
We can be the first.

210
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,189
Come on, we're Team Flash!

211
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:24,395
What did you put in his coffee?

212
00:11:24,398 --> 00:11:25,832
Okay, a black hole just showed up

213
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:27,765
and nearly swallowed Iris.

214
00:11:27,768 --> 00:11:30,429
So let's crunch the numbers,
find out where it went.

215
00:11:30,432 --> 00:11:32,785
I'm sorry, are we looking
at the same screen?

216
00:11:32,788 --> 00:11:35,598
Creating a search algorithm
for this is gonna be like

217
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,342
deciphering a mystery
wrapped up in an enigma.

218
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:39,371
Then it's a good thing

219
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:42,417
that "mystery" is my middle name.

220
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:47,134
The name's Dibny...

221
00:11:47,136 --> 00:11:49,854
Ralph Dibny.

222
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:51,763
Welcome back, Ralph.

223
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:54,349
- It's good to see you, man.
- Nice threads.

224
00:11:54,351 --> 00:11:56,435
- Where'd you get them?
- Picked this up in the Opal.

225
00:11:56,437 --> 00:11:57,984
A missing person's case

226
00:11:57,987 --> 00:11:59,271
sent you all the way to Opal City?

227
00:11:59,273 --> 00:12:00,814
And beyond, my friend.

228
00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:02,726
A summer spent
undercover rubbing Rolexes

229
00:12:02,729 --> 00:12:04,401
with the wealthy elite.

230
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:06,349
Did you guys know it's pronounced "yacht"

231
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,946
and not "yah-kt"?

232
00:12:07,948 --> 00:12:09,707
- Yep.
- God, I missed you.

233
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,542
Anyway, just following
any leads that might help

234
00:12:11,544 --> 00:12:14,225
explain the disappearance
of Sue Dearbon.

235
00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:16,625
I don't think I've ever seen
you this devoted to a case.

236
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:20,046
Me neither, but this
one is a real tragedy.

237
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:21,599
Maybe it was the look of desperation

238
00:12:21,602 --> 00:12:23,136
in her parents' eyes when they begged me

239
00:12:23,138 --> 00:12:24,579
to find their daughter.

240
00:12:24,582 --> 00:12:26,773
So, uh, what's new in Central City?

241
00:12:26,776 --> 00:12:29,777
We are trying to track a black hole.

242
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,757
Of course you are.

243
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,554
We were just about to start
decoding this data stream.

244
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:37,651
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

245
00:12:37,654 --> 00:12:39,871
Ugh, I'm sorry, sorry.

246
00:12:39,873 --> 00:12:42,132
Been having these
random frost-outs lately.

247
00:12:42,134 --> 00:12:44,450
- For how long?
- All summer.

248
00:12:44,452 --> 00:12:46,350
It's happened twice in
the last couple of days.

249
00:12:46,353 --> 00:12:48,213
Cait, you're probably overworked.

250
00:12:48,215 --> 00:12:49,627
Maybe take a time out?

251
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,457
A friend of mine did
want to meet for coffee.

252
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:53,835
- Ramsey?
- Yeah.

253
00:12:53,837 --> 00:12:55,336
It's never easy losing a parent.

254
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:57,463
Maybe you should take him up on it.

255
00:12:57,465 --> 00:12:59,649
I'll give him a call.

256
00:13:02,154 --> 00:13:04,488
Ah, found it.

257
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,450
Theft report for Leawood
and New Brighton junkyard.

258
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:09,535
See, I have a system.

259
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,773
You're a hoarder, but I love you.

260
00:13:10,775 --> 00:13:12,570
Iris.

261
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:17,859
Huh, these don't seem

262
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:19,610
to have anything to
do with the black hole.

263
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:22,488
They're just run-of-the-mill human thefts.

264
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,759
Well, you have a list
of persons of interest,

265
00:13:25,762 --> 00:13:27,952
- in any case.
- Yeah, thank you.

266
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:30,204
Um, I'll get right on this.

267
00:13:30,206 --> 00:13:32,715
Iris?

268
00:13:32,717 --> 00:13:35,293
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

269
00:13:35,295 --> 00:13:37,628
I... I don't know, maybe
I'm still a little shaken up

270
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,171
from the black hole.

271
00:13:39,173 --> 00:13:41,924
I'll be fine, thank you.

272
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:49,473
You remembered how I like my lattes.

273
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:51,893
With a bit of cinnamon, just like Mum.

274
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:53,870
You know, of all her
CC Hospital residents,

275
00:13:53,872 --> 00:13:55,688
she really took a special liking to you.

276
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:56,898
She was the first person

277
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,042
to realize that I was
into cutting-edge tech.

278
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:01,619
It was her letter of recommendation

279
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:04,196
that started my career at S.T.A.R. Labs.

280
00:14:06,075 --> 00:14:09,219
I couldn't save her, Cait.

281
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:12,222
Had to watch as her body betrayed her.

282
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,000
Do you know how HLH works?

283
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:18,395
Then you know the cancer
literally boils you

284
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:20,397
from the inside out.

285
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:26,052
Can you imagine what
that must have felt like?

286
00:14:26,054 --> 00:14:28,572
Watching her suffer...

287
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:32,642
That's my last memory of her.

288
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:34,226
Don't let it be.

289
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:37,655
What you said at the funeral
about how brave she was?

290
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:39,365
Remember that.

291
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:41,943
I lied.

292
00:14:41,945 --> 00:14:44,450
Truth is, she was a coward.

293
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:46,085
What do you mean?

294
00:14:46,088 --> 00:14:50,241
As a doctor, she knew her
chances of surviving were slim,

295
00:14:50,244 --> 00:14:53,913
so she just started ticking
things off her bucket list.

296
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:55,298
Isn't that a good thing?

297
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,208
She should have gone down fighting.

298
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,502
Instead, she ran away.

299
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:01,679
I didn't.

300
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:10,137
In HLH, white blood cells attack

301
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:11,514
the body's immune system.

302
00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:13,450
A median survival rate after diagnosis

303
00:15:13,452 --> 00:15:16,828
was two to six months.

304
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,696
Not anymore.

305
00:15:21,126 --> 00:15:24,369
Oh, my God, this is a potential cure.

306
00:15:24,371 --> 00:15:26,296
But what's the bonding agent

307
00:15:26,298 --> 00:15:28,798
strengthening the body's defenses?

308
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,234
Dark matter.

309
00:15:30,237 --> 00:15:32,135
I know what you're thinking, Cait.

310
00:15:32,137 --> 00:15:34,212
I thought the same
thing, too... at first.

311
00:15:34,214 --> 00:15:35,880
But I have been running
simulations for months,

312
00:15:35,882 --> 00:15:37,581
and they all show the same results.

313
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:39,000
My cure will work.

314
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:42,294
Or turn them into meta-humans
against their will.

315
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:43,398
But I can save lives.

316
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,961
I just need the dark matter
to start human trials.

317
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:49,467
And that's why you wanted
to get coffee with me.

318
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,688
S.T.A.R. Labs has the dark matter I need

319
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,681
to take the next step;
you have access to it.

320
00:15:53,683 --> 00:15:56,976
Ramsey, your research,
it's groundbreaking,

321
00:15:56,978 --> 00:15:59,145
but using dark matter?

322
00:15:59,147 --> 00:16:00,432
That's a deal-breaker.

323
00:16:00,435 --> 00:16:02,332
It wasn't when you made
the meta-human cure.

324
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:04,909
That was different. We
were trying to protect them.

325
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:07,611
Well, what about the rest of us?

326
00:16:10,992 --> 00:16:13,677
I'm sorry. I really am.

327
00:16:15,204 --> 00:16:17,555
But my answer is still no.

328
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:28,758
She didn't have to die, Cait.

329
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,218
No one with HLH does,

330
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,105
because you could help me stop it.

331
00:17:29,987 --> 00:17:33,155
Frost, where are you?

332
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:03,262
- How you feeling?
- Like I should be dead.

333
00:18:03,264 --> 00:18:05,381
That's not gonna
happen. We're Team Flash.

334
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:07,007
We always watch each other's backs.

335
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:08,342
We always keep each other safe.

336
00:18:08,344 --> 00:18:10,862
Meanwhile, over here in the real world,

337
00:18:10,864 --> 00:18:12,930
our black hole keeps growing up.

338
00:18:12,932 --> 00:18:16,034
Only next time it pops up,
it won't just be Jitters.

339
00:18:16,036 --> 00:18:17,768
The whole city could be in danger.

340
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,779
Why did this thing show
up outside Jitters, anyway?

341
00:18:19,781 --> 00:18:22,251
What does a coffee shop have
in common with a junkyard?

342
00:18:22,254 --> 00:18:24,951
I think I know who can tell us.

343
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:29,113
Okay, so I followed up with CCPD's list

344
00:18:29,115 --> 00:18:30,331
of junkyard robberies.

345
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,124
Ten of them were persons of interest,

346
00:18:32,126 --> 00:18:34,535
nine were career
criminals, but this one guy,

347
00:18:34,537 --> 00:18:36,888
a scientist, was let go with a warning

348
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,058
after being caught
stealing old lab equipment.

349
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,061
Team Flash, meet Chester P. Runk.

350
00:18:43,063 --> 00:18:46,130
Hey, what up, party people?

351
00:18:46,132 --> 00:18:48,090
Welcome to a world where all are welcome

352
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:52,052
and anything, including the
scientifically impossible,

353
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:55,073
can and probably will happen.

354
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:56,197
I'm your boy

355
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,474
Chugga-Chugga-Chugga-Chugga Chester...

356
00:18:58,477 --> 00:19:00,894
I really like him.

357
00:19:00,896 --> 00:19:03,990
With knowledge from the
bleeding edge of physics

358
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:07,159
and beyond-beyond-beyond.

359
00:19:07,161 --> 00:19:08,736
I've been working on that echo.

360
00:19:08,738 --> 00:19:12,331
And... and yes, as usual,
I am fueled by some...

361
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,592
mm, damn fine coffee

362
00:19:14,594 --> 00:19:16,910
from everyone's favorite beanery.

363
00:19:16,912 --> 00:19:19,747
Poured, of course, to, uh, perfection

364
00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:21,790
by a certain special someone.

365
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:25,436
Huh, huh, huh?

366
00:19:25,438 --> 00:19:29,089
Uh, no, WookieLover77, I...

367
00:19:29,091 --> 00:19:31,967
I have not asked her out yet,

368
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:33,761
but I got my punch card, okay?

369
00:19:33,763 --> 00:19:36,930
Three more Vibe-achinos and
I'm making my move, baby.

370
00:19:36,932 --> 00:19:38,807
I'm making my move, baby.

371
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:40,391
I'm making my move, baby!

372
00:19:40,394 --> 00:19:43,003
Okay, he talks about
Natalie for a while, so...

373
00:19:43,006 --> 00:19:44,938
There we go.

374
00:19:48,768 --> 00:19:50,703
Is he building what
I think he's building?

375
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:53,298
Behold, believers:

376
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,804
a gravitational wave emitter

377
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:56,541
powered by a modulated neutrino charger.

378
00:19:56,544 --> 00:19:58,160
In other words,

379
00:19:58,162 --> 00:20:00,954
"Time to call some aliens."

380
00:20:00,956 --> 00:20:04,058
- He built this in his garage?
- Using nothing but trash.

381
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,790
What a legend. Oh, he's turning it on.

382
00:20:06,793 --> 00:20:09,722
Uh... uh, no.

383
00:20:09,724 --> 00:20:12,675
No, no, no, that's not
supposed to do that.

384
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:15,320
Oh, crap. Uh, hold on.

385
00:20:21,778 --> 00:20:24,186
Okay, not exactly getting
the supervillain vibe

386
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:25,521
from our boy Chester here.

387
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:27,378
He opened a black hole by accident.

388
00:20:27,381 --> 00:20:29,165
And what about Chester? Is he okay?

389
00:20:29,168 --> 00:20:31,484
Well, police reports show
that EMTs took him to the ER,

390
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:33,195
but then after that the trail goes cold.

391
00:20:33,197 --> 00:20:34,863
Just a tiny question here:

392
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:38,492
how do we destroy a black hole?

393
00:20:47,428 --> 00:20:50,055
Well, I am not a doctor,

394
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:51,547
but I'm gonna assume in this case

395
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:53,674
that "negative" means a positive.

396
00:20:53,676 --> 00:20:54,859
Not if it means being clueless

397
00:20:54,861 --> 00:20:56,605
about why my powers won't work.

398
00:20:56,608 --> 00:20:59,346
Did anything out of the
ordinary happen recently?

399
00:20:59,348 --> 00:21:02,407
I went to my friend Ramsey's
mom's funeral yesterday.

400
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,826
Anything unusual about the service?

401
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,859
No, it was a lovely service

402
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:08,447
for an inspiring woman.

403
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,581
Then, today, I nearly
got sucked into oblivion.

404
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:13,552
Has our frosty femme fatale

405
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:16,422
ever refused to come
out like this before?

406
00:21:16,424 --> 00:21:19,992
The last time I can think of
is right after my dad died.

407
00:21:19,994 --> 00:21:21,410
Right.

408
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:22,674
So you think funeral

409
00:21:22,677 --> 00:21:25,042
plus nearly getting
sucked into a black hole

410
00:21:25,045 --> 00:21:28,002
equals Killer Frost is afraid of dying?

411
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:29,710
Maybe...

412
00:21:29,712 --> 00:21:32,063
but I know we're gonna figure this out.

413
00:21:41,991 --> 00:21:44,516
This place creeps me out.

414
00:21:46,228 --> 00:21:48,487
Will this sort you out?

415
00:21:50,324 --> 00:21:53,418
Nice doing business with you.

416
00:21:57,873 --> 00:21:59,465
Whoever pissed you off

417
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:03,561
won't be a problem anymore.

418
00:22:10,052 --> 00:22:12,135
Chester P. Runk is here?

419
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:16,556
Ward nurses say he's been
catatonic since he arrived.

420
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,392
Just involuntary muscle spasms.

421
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:27,901
Chester?

422
00:22:33,283 --> 00:22:36,243
My name is Iris West-Allen, I'm a reporter.

423
00:22:39,715 --> 00:22:42,299
Chester, can you hear me?

424
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:51,091
He was our only lead.

425
00:22:52,469 --> 00:22:54,111
Iris.

426
00:22:55,973 --> 00:22:59,933
You lost something of Nora's
last night, didn't you?

427
00:22:59,935 --> 00:23:02,602
Something that Joe
accidentally threw away,

428
00:23:02,604 --> 00:23:05,772
it ended up at that junkyard.

429
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,874
I just miss her so much.

430
00:23:17,786 --> 00:23:21,163
Every day, every minute.

431
00:23:21,165 --> 00:23:24,332
And I know that is selfish because...

432
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:26,811
one day I may get to see Nora again.

433
00:23:29,006 --> 00:23:30,787
But it won't be our Nora, you know?

434
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:34,241
The one that we knew, the
one that we have pictures of,

435
00:23:34,244 --> 00:23:36,178
the one that we grew
to love, you know...

436
00:23:39,141 --> 00:23:41,474
That Nora is gone forever.

437
00:23:44,646 --> 00:23:48,481
And I guess because of
that you know, I just...

438
00:23:48,483 --> 00:23:50,334
I don't know how I'm supposed to feel.

439
00:23:50,336 --> 00:23:53,745
Iris, you do not get to
cheat the grieving process

440
00:23:53,747 --> 00:23:56,924
just because you know you're
gonna see Nora again someday.

441
00:23:58,827 --> 00:24:01,878
Yeah, you're right.

442
00:24:01,881 --> 00:24:03,264
I guess I just haven't been able

443
00:24:03,267 --> 00:24:06,182
to put into words how I've been feeling.

444
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,359
Iris?

445
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,364
What is it?

446
00:24:28,782 --> 00:24:30,982
It's Chester.

447
00:24:39,126 --> 00:24:41,218
Oh, my God.

448
00:24:43,204 --> 00:24:45,538
You're looking at the world's first

449
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:48,959
inverse mass angular momentum disruptor,

450
00:24:48,961 --> 00:24:53,182
but we can just call
it a stellar grenade.

451
00:24:53,185 --> 00:24:54,660
Cool.

452
00:24:54,663 --> 00:24:57,188
So this will destroy the black hole?

453
00:24:57,191 --> 00:24:59,984
As long as it doesn't get much bigger,

454
00:24:59,987 --> 00:25:03,029
this will reverse the hole's
mass-collecting properties,

455
00:25:03,032 --> 00:25:04,365
causing it to...

456
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:05,533
Implode.

457
00:25:05,535 --> 00:25:07,827
Just toss it in the event horizon;

458
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:10,964
hasta lasagna,
don't get any on you.

459
00:25:10,966 --> 00:25:14,351
We can't.

460
00:25:14,353 --> 00:25:16,928
If we destroy it, we're
gonna kill Chester too.

461
00:25:24,248 --> 00:25:25,831
You sure about this?

462
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:28,161
Yeah, the corona's flair
matched the exact cadence

463
00:25:28,164 --> 00:25:29,343
of Chester's fingers.

464
00:25:29,346 --> 00:25:32,895
So the black hole and
Chester are connected?

465
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,781
Actually, I think Chester
is the black hole.

466
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:39,231
Watch this: so normally,
stimuli enters the brain

467
00:25:39,234 --> 00:25:41,330
through the sensory area,
goes up to the temporal lobe,

468
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:42,873
and then back around,

469
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,926
but watch what happens
in Chester's brain.

470
00:25:45,928 --> 00:25:47,411
It starts in the right area,

471
00:25:47,414 --> 00:25:49,689
but halfway through its
rotation, it disappears.

472
00:25:51,142 --> 00:25:53,091
I think I know where it's going.

473
00:25:55,363 --> 00:25:57,846
You're looking at a map of
the negative ionic energy

474
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:58,884
inside the black hole.

475
00:25:58,887 --> 00:26:00,565
Watch what happens when an energy pulse

476
00:26:00,568 --> 00:26:02,109
travels along its tendrils.

477
00:26:02,111 --> 00:26:04,612
See how it stops halfway?

478
00:26:06,542 --> 00:26:10,487
The black hole is the other
half of Chester's mind.

479
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,952
It's his consciousness.

480
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,654
Maybe it's been showing up

481
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:17,124
in places that hold an
emotional attachment for him,

482
00:26:17,126 --> 00:26:19,688
like the junkyard where he
stole stuff for his projects.

483
00:26:19,691 --> 00:26:21,357
He's got a crush on a girl at Jitters.

484
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,195
Okay, so all we have to
do is get Chester's mind

485
00:26:24,198 --> 00:26:26,374
out of the black hole,
reunite it with his body,

486
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:28,469
and once his condition stabilizes,

487
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:30,837
the black hole should just collapse.

488
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,174
Right, but they don't exactly
teach that in med school.

489
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,717
Okay, but we can't just let Chester die.

490
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,512
We have to do something.

491
00:26:41,484 --> 00:26:43,600
Look, I don't like saying it,

492
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:48,105
but I think we need to consider it.

493
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,439
Cisco, I know where you're going.

494
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,108
And you know we already have a way

495
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,592
of beating this before
it gets any bigger.

496
00:26:52,594 --> 00:26:54,861
- We're not discussing this.
- You think I like saying this?

497
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,572
I don't, but if we don't
find a solution for this

498
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,425
and find one now, we're
gonna have to make a choice

499
00:26:59,427 --> 00:27:00,927
down the line, and it's
either gonna be Chester

500
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:02,251
or it's gonna be
everyone in Central City.

501
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:05,097
I'm not losing anyone else!

502
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,676
I'm... let's find another way.

503
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:17,294
_

504
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,143
Where's the meltdown?

505
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,696
We gotta talk.

506
00:27:28,698 --> 00:27:31,624
What is your problem?

507
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:35,294
My problem is, we needed you,

508
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,297
and you were holed up in
your Snow-tress of Solitude.

509
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:40,115
I mean, you even refused
to come out at Jitters.

510
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,826
Flash was there, so spare
me the little hallway chat...

511
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:46,764
and I'm not afraid of dying.

512
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:49,809
I know that, but you
are afraid of living.

513
00:27:49,811 --> 00:27:53,170
Thomas' death, the funeral,
what happened at Jitters:

514
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,106
all those things happened to Caitlin.

515
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:56,798
She also led her high school debate team

516
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,175
to back-to-back championships.

517
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,511
She went to med school.
She married Ronnie.

518
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,416
- Those are her memories.
- Yes, I know.

519
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:05,807
I was there.

520
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,434
What's your point?

521
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,977
Having Caitlin's memories

522
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:11,330
isn't the same as having your own.

523
00:28:11,332 --> 00:28:13,023
Like you'd know anything about that.

524
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,500
I know it sucked sitting courtside

525
00:28:14,502 --> 00:28:16,693
for the Thinker show
when he hijacked my body,

526
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,321
and I think that you've been
going through something similar

527
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,865
since Thomas died.

528
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,417
And after being at that funeral,

529
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:26,178
seeing that woman live
the last days of her life

530
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,848
to the fullest, I
think that made you want

531
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,499
want to start living
your best life right now.

532
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:34,478
That's not my gig, okay?

533
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,931
I fight the bad guys, keep Caiti safe,

534
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:40,050
and then go back in my cage.

535
00:28:41,771 --> 00:28:44,196
I just have to deal with it.

536
00:28:44,198 --> 00:28:47,474
Have you thought to ask
Caitlin how she feels?

537
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,535
What's she gonna say?

538
00:28:49,537 --> 00:28:51,603
"Go ahead, Frost, take the wheel."

539
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,606
There's only one way to find out.

540
00:29:06,731 --> 00:29:09,129
You know, Barry, I think
it's time we faced the truth.

541
00:29:09,131 --> 00:29:11,632
I can't give up on Chester.

542
00:29:11,634 --> 00:29:13,801
No, I meant...

543
00:29:13,803 --> 00:29:16,637
About Nora.

544
00:29:16,639 --> 00:29:18,983
Look, I know we keep
saying that we're fine,

545
00:29:18,986 --> 00:29:23,137
but I still miss the
Nora that was, Barry,

546
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,979
not the Nora that will be,
and I think that you do too.

547
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:31,726
I think that's why you've been
working so hard all summer.

548
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:37,416
I thought if I could keep people safe,

549
00:29:37,418 --> 00:29:40,068
that it would make up
for how much I miss her.

550
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,615
Think all the work this
summer and the long hours,

551
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,260
pushing myself, pushing the team...

552
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:52,673
It's so I could avoid
what scares me the most...

553
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:58,011
That I'll never get over this.

554
00:29:58,013 --> 00:30:00,940
There is no support group
for what we're experiencing.

555
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,115
You know why I was at that junkyard?

556
00:30:12,695 --> 00:30:15,353
I lost my purple jacket.

557
00:30:17,366 --> 00:30:19,125
And I was obsessed

558
00:30:19,127 --> 00:30:23,192
with getting it back because...

559
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:28,450
You know, in my mind...

560
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,496
Nora needs it.

561
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:35,716
You know, she needs it to become XS.

562
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:42,815
And when that thing
swallowed it, just...

563
00:30:42,817 --> 00:30:44,650
just for, like, a tiny second,

564
00:30:44,652 --> 00:30:47,594
I wanted it to swallow me too.

565
00:30:56,971 --> 00:30:59,022
You know, the only way
we're gonna get through this

566
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:02,984
is if we carry this burden together.

567
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,504
It's the only way, Barry.

568
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:16,757
We just ran out of time.

569
00:31:28,071 --> 00:31:30,187
Okay, so how do we get
Chester's consciousness

570
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,396
out of the black hole?

571
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:34,650
Well, the electrical impulses
that make up Chester's mind

572
00:31:34,653 --> 00:31:36,987
are just past the
black hole's threshold,

573
00:31:36,989 --> 00:31:39,739
but since his synaptic energy
has a negative charge...

574
00:31:39,741 --> 00:31:41,157
I could use my
lightning's positive charge

575
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:42,038
to attract his energy.

576
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,283
- Like a magnet.
- Exactly.

577
00:31:43,286 --> 00:31:45,950
Then what? I mean, how are you
gonna survive inside of there?

578
00:31:45,953 --> 00:31:47,372
Well, your... your Speed Force aura

579
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:49,231
should protect you, right?

580
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:50,475
What if it doesn't?

581
00:31:50,478 --> 00:31:52,376
The gravimetric forces will crush you

582
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:53,837
to a subatomic size within seconds.

583
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:54,714
That's not gonna happen.

584
00:31:54,716 --> 00:31:56,430
The Speed Force is a
billion times stronger

585
00:31:56,433 --> 00:31:57,748
than any gravimetric force.

586
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:00,470
Even if you do survive the
entry, we don't have a way

587
00:32:00,473 --> 00:32:03,322
of keeping Chester's mind
intact on the way out.

588
00:32:03,324 --> 00:32:05,390
We'd need superconductive wiring

589
00:32:05,392 --> 00:32:07,034
from a quantum computer to do that,

590
00:32:07,036 --> 00:32:09,949
and last time I checked,
those only exist in the future.

591
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:13,440
Nora.

592
00:32:13,442 --> 00:32:16,041
Our Nora, she can still help us.

593
00:32:16,044 --> 00:32:17,861
Oh, my God, her back-up gauntlet.

594
00:32:17,863 --> 00:32:19,159
Cisco, it's still here.

595
00:32:19,162 --> 00:32:21,381
That gauntlet's gonna
have the filament we need.

596
00:32:21,384 --> 00:32:22,866
I'll strip it out and
thread it into your suit.

597
00:32:22,868 --> 00:32:24,046
Okay, in the meantime, Ralph,

598
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:26,369
can you and Frost help
CCPD evacuate downtown?

599
00:32:26,371 --> 00:32:30,373
Frost is ready to come out
and to use Cisco's present.

600
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:41,309
Captain, you shouldn't be out here!

601
00:32:41,312 --> 00:32:42,427
It's my city too.

602
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:43,678
Help these people get out of here.

603
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,406
Yes, sir!

604
00:32:56,793 --> 00:32:59,485
No!

605
00:33:07,537 --> 00:33:09,171
Run, dude.

606
00:33:17,848 --> 00:33:20,423
- You're welcome.
- Suit's finished.

607
00:33:20,425 --> 00:33:23,635
Okay, great, so when Barry
gets Chester's consciousness

608
00:33:23,637 --> 00:33:25,354
out of there, what is he supposed to do

609
00:33:25,356 --> 00:33:26,523
with that energy?

610
00:33:26,526 --> 00:33:29,302
- You remember the MAC?
- Yeah, but it's not working.

611
00:33:29,305 --> 00:33:30,859
No, but the structural integrity

612
00:33:30,861 --> 00:33:33,528
is strong enough to
contain synaptic energy.

613
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:36,457
Besides, we already moved
Chester into it, so...

614
00:33:36,459 --> 00:33:39,126
I'm sorry, what? "We" moved Chester?

615
00:33:39,128 --> 00:33:40,301
That's right.

616
00:33:40,304 --> 00:33:42,870
I may be small, but I
can bench my body weight.

617
00:33:50,163 --> 00:33:52,038

Can you hear me?

00:35:46,571 --> 00:35:49,715
Come back here, to us,

653
00:35:49,717 --> 00:35:53,093
to this body, to yourself.

654
00:35:55,414 --> 00:35:58,780
What up, party people?

655
00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:01,637
Hey... hey, you're the Flash.

656
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,270
With the speeding around and
the lightning and all that.

657
00:36:04,273 --> 00:36:07,015
Hey, big fan, man, big fan.

658
00:36:07,017 --> 00:36:09,568
Also, where am I?

659
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,038
Chester is doing so much better.

660
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,392
I mean, don't get me wrong,
he's still, you know, glowing

661
00:36:23,394 --> 00:36:25,042
in the eyes with orange dark energy,

662
00:36:25,044 --> 00:36:26,753
but he's in really good spirits.

663
00:36:26,755 --> 00:36:28,304
How long until he gets out?

664
00:36:28,306 --> 00:36:30,548
Caitlin said his molecules
need to destabilize

665
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,975
at the subatomic level.

666
00:36:31,977 --> 00:36:33,885
My guess is he'll
need to cook in the MAC

667
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:36,339
for another four to
six weeks, maybe more,

668
00:36:36,342 --> 00:36:37,623
until he's back to normal.

669
00:36:37,626 --> 00:36:39,932
Well, believe me, he is
more than happy to chill here

670
00:36:39,934 --> 00:36:41,818
at S.T.A.R. Labs in the meantime.

671
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,436
And when he does get out, that boy knows

672
00:36:43,438 --> 00:36:45,146
exactly what he wants to do.

673
00:36:45,148 --> 00:36:47,482
Mm, definitely gonna ask Natalie out.

674
00:36:47,484 --> 00:36:48,775
Speaking of going out,

675
00:36:48,777 --> 00:36:50,818
Kamilla and I are
doing shawarma Tuesday,

676
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,996
so I'm gonna mosey.

677
00:36:52,998 --> 00:36:56,783
Of course, moseying is a lot
harder these days post-Vibe.

678
00:36:56,785 --> 00:36:59,243
Showing up to a date
in a S.T.A.R. Lab van,

679
00:36:59,245 --> 00:37:00,375
not a good look.

680
00:37:00,378 --> 00:37:02,580
Mm, no. I'll give you a ride.

681
00:37:02,582 --> 00:37:04,766
And risk looking like my
mom just dropped me off?

682
00:37:04,768 --> 00:37:08,461
Ooh, even better, you can walk.

683
00:37:08,463 --> 00:37:10,346
Okay, I'm coming.

684
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:14,586
It never occurred to me

685
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:17,327
that you might want to live a life.

686
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,549
That's why I never
offered to let you drive,

687
00:37:19,552 --> 00:37:21,613
not because I think you're
only good in a fight.

688
00:37:21,616 --> 00:37:22,807
You sure?

689
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,434
I know it's a really big ask,

690
00:37:24,436 --> 00:37:26,787
and I don't want you feeling
obligated or whatever.

691
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:29,623
Frost, you have always
been there for me,

692
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:32,126
protecting me.

693
00:37:32,128 --> 00:37:35,037
Now I get to do something for you.

694
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:37,823
Besides, even though it's always felt

695
00:37:37,825 --> 00:37:39,708
like you were a part of me,

696
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,711
for the first time, it
feels like I'm a part of you.

697
00:37:42,713 --> 00:37:44,880
Thank you.

698
00:37:44,882 --> 00:37:47,123
Any time.

699
00:37:55,646 --> 00:37:58,152
Guess everything's
coming up frosty, huh?

700
00:37:58,154 --> 00:38:00,488
Yeah, I guess.

701
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:03,324
Where do I start?

702
00:38:03,326 --> 00:38:06,327
How do you, you know, live a life?

703
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:09,312
With a life coach, of course.

704
00:38:11,567 --> 00:38:14,240
So, first thing's
first: the name "Killer,"

705
00:38:14,243 --> 00:38:15,819
it's a little bit too
much for some folks.

706
00:38:15,821 --> 00:38:17,362
Have you thought about changing it?

707
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:19,748
My mom's middle name is Anne.

708
00:38:54,067 --> 00:38:56,710
I will never accept death,

709
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:58,987
not like you did.

710
00:39:28,352 --> 00:39:30,352
So, what made you believe

711
00:39:30,355 --> 00:39:32,958
that you could carry
Chester out of that place?

712
00:39:32,961 --> 00:39:36,221
You made me believe I could do it.

713
00:39:36,224 --> 00:39:40,758
I realized we could be
each other's support group,

714
00:39:40,761 --> 00:39:43,195
even though it's gonna take some time.

715
00:39:43,198 --> 00:39:45,473
If we can carry a
memory like this together

716
00:39:45,476 --> 00:39:47,869
in our hearts, carrying
somebody's consciousness

717
00:39:47,872 --> 00:39:50,113
out of a black hole?

718
00:39:50,116 --> 00:39:51,736
It's a piece of cake.

719
00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:55,918
Besides, how else could
I get this back for you?

720
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:09,951
I know it's not as
good as Nora's video...

721
00:40:16,292 --> 00:40:18,358
It's better.

722
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,111
Now we have something that
we can honor Nora with.

723
00:40:21,113 --> 00:40:23,280
She was pretty "schway."

724
00:40:35,979 --> 00:40:37,961
What do you want?

725
00:40:37,963 --> 00:40:40,683
For your universe to survive.

726
00:40:40,686 --> 00:40:42,638
The plinth...

727
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:43,837
you destroyed it.

728
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,149
You destroyed Nora's message.

729
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:48,704
An unfortunate side effect.

730
00:40:48,707 --> 00:40:51,204
But I needed to discourage you.

731
00:40:51,207 --> 00:40:52,975
From doing what?

732
00:40:52,978 --> 00:40:54,853
Hoping.

733
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:57,438
Your determination
is boundless, Flash...

734
00:40:57,441 --> 00:40:59,498
it is one of your greatest qualities...

735
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:01,665
but you cannot avoid the coming Crisis.

736
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,871
Barry has five years before he vanishes.

737
00:41:03,874 --> 00:41:05,623
No longer.

738
00:41:05,626 --> 00:41:09,461
December 10, 2019.

739
00:41:09,464 --> 00:41:13,155
On that day, he will answer the call

740
00:41:13,158 --> 00:41:15,426
and make the ultimate sacrifice.

741
00:41:15,429 --> 00:41:17,787
Soon...

742
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,623
this world will fight for the fate

743
00:41:19,626 --> 00:41:21,203
of all the known universes.

744
00:41:21,206 --> 00:41:23,707
I'm not gonna leave my family.

745
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,898
There has to be a way
to stop what's coming.

746
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:28,122
I am sorry,

747
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:29,833
but events have been set into motion

748
00:41:29,836 --> 00:41:31,904
that you cannot possibly comprehend.

749
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:34,291
I don't need to understand them!

750
00:41:34,294 --> 00:41:35,753
Just tell me what I can do.

751
00:41:35,756 --> 00:41:38,666
To survive?

752
00:41:38,669 --> 00:41:40,692
You can't.

753
00:41:40,695 --> 00:41:42,671
In order for billions to survive

754
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:45,532
this coming Crisis,

755
00:41:45,535 --> 00:41:48,420
the Flash must die.

756
